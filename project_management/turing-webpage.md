# 'The Turing Way' - A handbook for reproducible data science

Developing a handbook for best practice in academic data science

## Introduction

Reproducible research is work that can be independently verified.
In practice, it means sharing the data and code that were used to generate published results - yet this is often easier said than done.
'The Turing Way' is a guide to reproducible data science that will support students and academics as they develop their code, with the aim of helping them produce work that will be regarded as gold-standard examples of trustworthy and reusable research.

## Project aims

In the ideal case, all published results should be independently verifiable and suitable for other researchers to build upon.
For this to happen, the data and code that support the publication need to be made available in an easy-to-use and open format.

Sharing these research outputs means understanding data management, library sciences, software development and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers and data scientists.

'The Turing Way' is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible data science is 'too easy not to do'.
It will include training material on version control, analysis testing and open and transparent communication with future users, and build on Turing Institute case studies and workshops.

## Applications

'The Turing Way' will support everybody involved in data science research: the developers of the code (research engineers, postdocs and doctoral students), their supervisors and the business team members who coordinate these projects.
The format will be easy for the reader to dip in and out of, depending on their level of experience in the various topics.
The project will help to answer questions that researchers don't always ask: "How do I ensure that my code's existing functionality doesn't change as I extend the codebase?", "How do I make my project easy for someone else to run?", and many more.

Senior team members - Turing fellows, program directors and managers - will be catered for with key points tailored towards managing reproducible research projects highlighted for each topic covered.
The project will build and curate checklists for what can be done to ensure all project outputs are reproducible.
A chapter on Binder will be of interest to supervisors who want to regularly review their students' code, and will include the technical details of how to set up a BinderHub that will be useful for research software engineers.

## Recent updates

### April 2019

#### Book dash announcement

The Turing Way team are excited to announce our two Book Dashes, which take place in May.
If you have a chapter idea that’s waiting to be written, case studies that you’d like to share, or have science communication skills that you’d like to use to improve our existing content, [fill in an application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-HTay3kRowSAPIqslSIeDXpvFWptOjmO9m1uEcUf0YElcqw/viewform?fbzx=2301958820436580386) to join us for a day of collaborative writing.

Each of our book dashes will begin with dinner and lightning talks in the evening, and we’ll get off to an early start on the second day by splitting into teams and working on our chosen aspects of the book.

University of Manchester: 6:30pm Thursday 16th - 5pm Friday 17th May
The Alan Turing Institute: 6:30pm Monday 27th - 5pm Tuesday 28th May

The deadline for applications is Friday 19th April, and we’ll get back to you with our decisions by Friday 26th April.

#### SSI Collaborations Workshop

The Software Sustainability Institute's Collaborations Workshop was a busy time for members of the Turing Way team. Patricia Herterich's talk "Interoperable as in FAIR – A librarian’s personal point of view" and Kirstie Whitaker's mini-workshop on the Turing Way linked in with the first and last of this year's conference themes of Interoperability, Documentation and Training.

We had two Turing Way-focussed teams at the hackday – thank you to everyone who contributed towards the book and the checklists!

### March 2019

We ran three successful workshops in March – many thanks to those who attended!

#### Boost your research reproducibility with Binder

Our two workshops to [boost research reproducibility with Binder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/boost-research-reproducibility-binder) in Manchester and London were attended by 30 people.
We had a great mix of presentations and hands-on exercises and our feedback was really positive.
Every attendee said they felt confident using Binder to share their work reproducibly!

#### Build a BinderHub

We hosted the first ever [Build a BinderHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/workshops/build-a-binderhub) workshop in Sheffield on 18 March 2019.
In addition to learning how to build a BinderHub (and having the most BinderHubs ever in existence in parallel!), participants were introduced to [Mozilla's principles of working openly](http://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/).
They practically applied the principles and fed back ideas for new features to the Binder community or enhanced the existing documentation.

#### Blog post

A [blog post](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2019-03-05-turing-way-open-source-resource-promoting-best-practice-reproducible-research) about the Turing Way by Becky Arnold, Turing Way team member and SSI Fellow, has been published on the SSI blog.

### February 2019

Three chapters - reproducibility, open research and version control - are complete and ready for your comments.
