# Prototyping or Ideas Generation Session

By a prototyping or an ideas generation session, which in UK academia can also be termed a sandbox, we mean a group activity focused on brain storming around a theme which can a particular problem or set of problems or on how to get the most of a new technology, technique or material etc.
These activities tend to also act as a way to introduce people who have shared concerns but will not previously have met as they are from different disciplines or communities.

## Requirements

Usually, at a prototyping or an ideas generation events you have a lead or chair who co-ordinates the activity.
The session will start with each person introducing themselves and providing details of where their interests are relevant to the theme of the session. At small events where the participants may also be asked to bring an item or items that represents them or the topic that interests them.
At a larger event there may be too many participants to allow everyone to interduce themselves in which case there will be an introduction and selected participants will give a presentation.

Once everyone understands the theme and has been introduced there will a networking session or breakout sessions.
Generally, at this point the chair will identify topics or sub-themes and note them down so that all can see.

A networking session allows people to mingle and find other participants with shared interests.
If there are good common themes or sub-themes then the chair may help participants find participants with shared interests.
This could be down by putting a flip chart of post-its in different parts of a room so that participants can cluster and talk.

Alternatively break out sessions can be more structured and allow the participants to talk, do an activity such as making notes for a blog or notes for post-its or drawing pictures of products or art works.
More creative sessions may provide a maker space or materials to build prototypes.
The break-out groups can be self-organised from the ‘grass roots’ or the chair may allocate participants to groups and may event move them between a number of break out groups and sessions so that for example every participant is shares at least 1 break out session with every other participant.

At the end of the event there will be a wrap up session where all the participants get together to share the results of the networking or breakout session.
Each break out group or participant is asked to share the ideas that they generated to the whole group.
Once complete the top ideas are selected by the group or by the chair.
This often ends with a networking session where participants can share their contact details so that they can continue working together on ideas that have come out of the event.

The session can end here however if the participants want further involvement then in follow up activities are useful.
These are especially important if the original event was aimed at generating ideas for a funding call or art exhibition.
Follow on activities may include making the generated ideas and the participants contact details online available to all who want to continue; or a coffee morning; or a weekly meet-up.

But for an online prototyping or ideas generation event you need a variety of online meeting areas and tools.
Networking is a social activity but in this case the participants will need help other useful participants.
Break-outs will need other online collaborative working tools such as for note taking, programming, graphics such as CAD files, 3D printing files or photographs.
Co-ordinating the booking and sharing all of the necessary online tools along with information about them with each participant and break-out group is challenging especially as often digital resources do not have meaningful identifiers and may be supplied by a different vendor with different licensing rules.
These types of events work best with small groups as participants get to know each other better and the size of the group is an important consideration when you go online.

## Solutions

There are several different types of online tools required for this type of event.

- Online meetings systems with the capacity for many break-out or sub-sessions
- Collaborative working tools - generally speaking these will be for text, white borads or story boards however specialist communities may want to use all sorts of tools depending on the time they are alloted.
  A long time is similar to a hack event where things other than coding may be done.
- Sharing concept and ideas eg picture boards (piminterest)
- Navigation tools to allow the chair and participants to co-ordinate their activities easily
