# Presentation/Talk Sessions

A presentation or talk is an activity where one person addresses a room on a topic using a slide deck as a means of supporting or expressing their point.
Talks can be given in a variety of styles, for example:

- **Keynotes:** These are longer presentations given by an expert in a field related to the event.
  They usually tie into a theme of the event, such as "High Performance Computing" or "sustainability".
- **Lightning talks:** A _very_ short (between 2 and 5 minutes and 1 to 3 slides) presentation.
  These are often used to inform the audience of other events in the program, such as workshops or tutorials, but can also be used to start longer, informal discussions on other topics, such as community growth or feedback.

At in-person events, presentations usually take place in a lecture theatre or auditorium where technical considerations need to be taken into account, such as:

- Can the speaker control their slides from their own laptop or do they have to transfer it to another machine?
- Is there a microphone available to amplify the speaker so the audience can hear clearly and comfortably?
- Does the projector/screen sufficiently display the slides? Is the correct connector provided?
- Time-tracking. Is there a clock for the speaker to track time or is the session chair providing that feedback?
- Are there extras the speaker may need, for example, a laser pointer?
- How are questions being gathered for a Q&A session (if applicable)?

When we move such talks and presentations online, we can be met with fundamentally similar problems but they may require different solutions given the different environment the presentation is taking place in and the different technologies that are being used.

## Requirements

There are certain tools and must-haves to ensure the successful hosting of a remote presentation.

- A stable video conferencing service that allows screen sharing
- A method of collecting questions from the audience and feeding the answers back from the speaker
- A process and/or tool for time-keeping
- A place to test equipment and features, such as microphones and screen sharing.

## Solutions

- **Pre-recorded talks:** One of the largest challenges facing online events is the dreaded spotty internet connection.
  One way to overcome this is to ask speakers if they would be comfortable pre-recording their talks such that someone (the session chair or a member of the organising committee) can play the recording over a more stable internet connection.
  It is very important that, if taking this route, organisers should give speakers plenty of time to prepare and record their presentations.
  Detailed instructions on how to record their presentation, what format the video should be in and who/where it should be shared are also important points speakers will want to be clear about.
- **Collaborative platforms for collating questions:** In a remote scenario, asking the audience to write down their questions in a collaborative document is beneficial as this will make it difficult for one person to dominate the Q&A session, other audience members can "upvote" popular questions, and organisers/chairs can monitor whether the questions are abiding by the Code of Conduct.
- **In-browser timers:** An in-browser timer can be a useful way for a speaker/chair to track time during the presentation.
  They are lightweight, do not require installation and can easily be shared with participants and via screen sharing. For example, <http://amazingtimer.com/countdown_timer.php>.

## Available Tools

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us) is a very popular video conferencing platform that includes screen sharing for multiple participants.
Other benefits include support for a large number of participants, breakout rooms to facilitate discussions between smaller groups, and a chat feature.
- [sli.do](https://www.sli.do/) is a platform for to collect questions for Q&A sessions.
Users login to their event that can be split into sessions relating to each talk.
They can then submit questions which can be upvoted by other users.
A session chair can then moderate these question and pose them to the speaker.
