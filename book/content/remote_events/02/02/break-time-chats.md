## Break-time chats

While a lot of people will wish to switch off from their screens during break-times and lunch-times, some will wish to meet new people or continue conversations they had started during the event.
Consider keeping the main conferencing room open all day for people to pop into and out of.
Also, consider making several social break out rooms for people to use as they wish during the event.
A "quiet" room for people to join but not speak may also be useful, for people to still feel connected to the conference (and receive chat messages) but have a break from talks / workshop events.
