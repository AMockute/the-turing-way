# Social Interactions

## Introduction

By social interaction we mean any planned or unplanned chats, meetings or trips that in large part involve interacting with other attendees in a social manner.

Usually, at an in-person workshop or conference you have a range of social and networking opportunities available.
This may include: icebreakers, cultural trips such as to a local historic landmark or museum, a main conference dinner or celebration, and smaller interactions such as pub visits and break-time chats.
Is it possible to recreate these events online? The resources available to online conferences may be more limited, however the social experience can still be rich.
We now present several ideas to turn in-person social events to online social events.
Throughout all of these it is important to consider whether resources would be accessible to all members of your group.
