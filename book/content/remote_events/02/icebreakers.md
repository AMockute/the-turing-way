## Icebreakers

Icebreakers are a great way of creating first links between attendees.
This is especially important at an online workshops and conferences where spontaneous interactions occur less often.
Additionally, having a well run icebreaker at the beginning of each day can set a more open and collaborative tone for your event.
Depending on the number of attendees it is likely that you will want to divide the group into breakout rooms using your conferencing software.
Here are some suggestions:

- Divide into groups of up to four people with a time limit of two to three minutes.
  Ask attendees to introduce themselves and to share something specific about themselves (e.g. their favourite food, where they most recently went on holiday, what they are currently watching on TV, etc.).
  Inspired from [Collaborations Workshop 2020](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw20).
