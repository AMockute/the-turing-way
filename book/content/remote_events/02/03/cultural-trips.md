## Cultural trips

There are many online resources for exploring virtual exhibits and landmarks.
Using software that allows screen sharing, a conference facilitator can share their screen for the group to view an exhibit.
Alternatively, some time can be set aside for attendees to find exhibits that interest them (for example in [Google Art & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/)).
Chat facilities can be used for attendees to link to recommended exhibits.

Where can the online exhibits be found?

- There may be online resources for a historic landmark local to you.
- If there are no resources online for local landmarks, then why not go world-wide? [Google Art & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/) have a large collection of virtual exhibits. Here are some examples:
  - [Cremonese violin making](https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/cremonese-violin-making/gQFHhBg4)
  - [Discover 10 of the World's Zaniest Buildings](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/mAUhHW4vOVDErA)
  - [Exploring the Ripley Scroll](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/exploring-the-ripley-scroll/sgLCNEuJqIJzLg)
