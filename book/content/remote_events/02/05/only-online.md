## Only online

Some social interactions are best placed online! Here are some examples:

- A daily challenge.
  Ask attendees to post a picture a day to a shared chat.
  Example challenges include: "What is the view out of your window?", "Best pet!" and "What have you been cooking?".
  Attendees could vote on a winner every day.
