# Naming files, folders and other things 

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level

None.

## Summary

Good names for files, folders and other things can make your life and the life of collaborators and other people using your research much easier.
It allows others to understand what the digital object is about and at the same time good names are easy for computers to understand and process.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful

Using good names is probably the easiest way to improve reproducibility and reusability of your research project.

## Chapter content

There are three principles to naming things. The first two apply to all kinds of things. The third is optional and especially valuable for files. File names should be:

1. Machine readable
2. Human readable
3. Optional: Play well with default ordering

Let's look at some examples of bad (No) and good (Yes) file names.
