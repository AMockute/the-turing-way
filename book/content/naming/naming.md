# Naming files, folders and other things 

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level

None.

## Summary

Good names for files, folders and other things can make your life and the life of collaborators and other people using your research much easier.
It allows others to understand what the digital object is about and at the same time good names are easy for computers to understand and process.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful

Using good names is probably the easiest way to improve reproducibility and reusability of your research project.

## Chapter content

There are three principles to naming things. The first two apply to all kinds of things. The third is optional and especially valuable for files. File names should be:

1. Machine readable
2. Human readable
3. Optional: Play well with default ordering


Before we dive into the details of waht they mean, let's look at some examples of bad and good file names.

| Bad              | Good             |
| -----------------|------------------|
|`Myabstract.docx` | `2020-06-08_abstract-for-sla.docx` |
|`Joeâ€™s Filenames Use Spaces and Punctuation.xlsx` | `Joes-filenames-are-getting-better.xlsx` |
|`figure 1.png` | `Fig01_scatterplot-talk-length-vs-interest.png` |
|`fig 2.png` | `Fig02_histogram-talk-attendance.png` |
|`JW7d^(2sl@deletethisandyourcareerisoverWx2*.txt` | `1986-01-28_raw-data-from-challenger-o-rings.txt` |


### Machine readable

Names of digital components should be easy to understand for computers.
Computers like names to have no spaces, deliberate use of delimiters, and no special or accented characters.
Also computers are case sensitive, so for them `cat.txt` and `Cat.txt` are different files.

Good file/folder names are easy to search for (also using regular expressions) and easy to compute on (for example by splitting on `_` characters).


### Human readable

To achieve human readability, it is helpful to have a name that contains information on the content of the file/folder or other thing. For URLs this consept is called [clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL).



### Play well with default ordering

To create a good default ordering, adding number at the beginning of the name, is often a good idea. 
Imagine you have a folder with als you presentation slides, it would probably be helpful to have them ordered by date. 
So starting the file names with `year-month-day` (for example `2020-02-21`), does that for you.
We recommend using something like the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for dates. 
If you use other number, we recommend left padding them with zeros, because your computer will order `003 < 004 < 020 < 100` as opposed to `100 < 20 < 3 < 4`. 
From experience we know that naming folders according to a logical number can lead to a mess if the ordering changes.
For example you have book chapter folders `01_introduction`, `02_naming_files`, `03_naming_folders`, and so on and then you decide to change the order or try to squeeze in a folder in between `01_introduction` and `02_naming_files`, this leads to more downsides than upsides.
