# Diving into Leadership

Hackathons can be quite intimidating scenarios to put yourself into.
You're probably meeting a whole load of new people and getting to grips with a new project or programming language.
On top of that, you probably only have a couple of days or less to produce something to show for your time!

Now imagine if it was your job to lead and coordinate that group of people to work on your own project?

Don't worry! I've been there, and I was intimidated too!
So let me share some of things I learned the first time I lead a hackathon project.

## Don't just focus on the code

There are lots of different things that go into making a project, beyond the code itself.
Similarly, there are lots of different people with different skills who may join your hackathon project - not just programmers!
Good leaders can identify the strengths of their team and specifically where their skills can be put to best use on a project.

Things like documentation are often left until the last moments of a project even though it's just as important, if not more so, than the code itself!
If you have someone on your team who likes to write, documentation can be kept up-to-date as your codebase changes through the hackathon.

The largest benefit of having a well documented piece of software at the end of the hackathon is that it will be much easier for your team to continue to contribute to the project after the event.
The last phase of getting a project into a production ready state takes the most time and effort, but luckily you've already documented your scoping process and pathway to getting there! :wink:

## I found my strength as a leader

> You might remember at the beginning of this blog post I mentioned that I’d never led a hack project before, so I also learned a lot about my leadership capabilities.
> I think I did well. I identified the strengths of each of my team members and gave them a task suited to them whilst letting them explore new concepts, offering my own insight and opinions when required.
> I also think that it was a good choice for me to not be too involved in the coding aspect of this project. Managing the flow into the repository and updating the documentation as new code came in meant that I managed to maintain an overall perspective of the project and could switch gears as questions came in from different areas. I don’t think I could have maintained such a view if I’d been buried in code, and I can always learn from the scripts that we’ve developed at a later point.
