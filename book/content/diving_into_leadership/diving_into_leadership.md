# Diving into Leadership

Hackathons can be quite intimidating scenarios to put yourself into.
You're probably meeting a whole load of new people and getting to grips with a new project or programming language.
On top of that, you probably only have a couple of days or less to produce something to show for your time!

Now imagine if it was your job to lead and coordinate that group of people to work on your own project?

Don't worry! I've been there, and I was intimidated too!
So let me share some of things I learned the first time I lead a hackathon project.

## Don't just focus on the code

There are lots of different things that go into making a project, beyond the code itself.
Similarly, there are lots of different people with different skills who may join your hackathon project - not just programmers!
Good leaders can identify the strengths of their team and specifically where their skills can be put to best use on a project.

Things like documentation are often left until the last moments of a project even though it's just as important, if not more so, than the code itself!
If you have someone on your team who likes to write, documentation can be kept up-to-date as your codebase changes through the hackathon.

The largest benefit of having a well documented piece of software at the end of the hackathon is that it will be much easier for your team to continue to contribute to the project after the event.
The last phase of getting a project into a production ready state takes the most time and effort, but luckily you've already documented your scoping process and pathway to getting there! :wink:

## Find your style of leadership

Given this was my first hackathon as a project lead, I found it very beneficial for me to be operating at quite a high-level on the project, rather than taking a deep dive into the code.

I felt much more able to keep track of the project as a whole and could more easily identify whose skills best suited certain tasks.
I also found it much easier to mentally switch gears if a team member asked for help or input because I didn't have to disentangle myself from a coding mindset.

Hackathons can also turn GitHub repositories into a the Wild West of version control - so it's not a bad idea to have someone managing issues and pull requests as new work comes in.

Now just because this leadership style worked for me, that's not to say it's right for you.
It make take some time but it's important to find a style you're most comfortable with.

## Summary

In short, I think hackathons put a lot of emphasis on the coding aspect of project development (helped along by the [unfortunate naming convention](https://github.com/hackseq/October_2016/issues/24)), but this is not the sole pillar on which a good project stands.
