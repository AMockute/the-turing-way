# Reframing "Diving into Leadership" Blog

Hackathons can be quite intimidating scenarios to put yourself into. You're probably meeting a whole load of new people, getting to grips with a new project or programming language, and you probably only have a couple of days or less to produce something to show for your time!

Now imagine if it was your job to lead and coordinate that group of people to work on your own project?

Don't worry! I've been there, and I was intimidated too! So let me share some of things I learned the first time I lead a hackathon project.

## There’s a role for everyone in a team and these are equally important

> Even if it’s reviewing code or writing documentation, these are as important (arguably, more so) than the code itself. Code that does what you think it’s doing and has been explained well will have a much longer lifespan than code that is difficult to follow, regardless of how clever it is, and poorly documented.

There are lots of different things that go into making a project, beyond the code itself. Similarly, there are lots of different people with different skills who may join your hackathon project, not just programmers! Good leaders can identify the strengths of their team and specifically where their skills can be put to best use on a project.

Things like documentation are often left until the last moments of a project even though it's just as important, if not more so, than the code itself! However if you have someone on your team who likes to write, documentation can be kept up to date as 

## I found my strength as a leader

> You might remember at the beginning of this blog post I mentioned that I’d never led a hack project before, so I also learned a lot about my leadership capabilities.
> I think I did well. I identified the strengths of each of my team members and gave them a task suited to them whilst letting them explore new concepts, offering my own insight and opinions when required.
> I also think that it was a good choice for me to not be too involved in the coding aspect of this project. Managing the flow into the repository and updating the documentation as new code came in meant that I managed to maintain an overall perspective of the project and could switch gears as questions came in from different areas. I don’t think I could have maintained such a view if I’d been buried in code, and I can always learn from the scripts that we’ve developed at a later point.
