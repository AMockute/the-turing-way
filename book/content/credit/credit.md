## Summary
> easy to understand summary - a bit like tl;dr

## How this will help you/ why this is useful
> why we think you should read the whole thing

## Chapter content
> depending on the content, this might be more structured, e.g. with exercises, gotcha sections etc

- Making stuff citable
  - *Can this just link to other chapters mainly?*
  - Data
    - Deposit it
  - Software
    - Deposit it (github isn't good enough)
    - Software journals (e.g. [JORS][], [JOSS][])
- Citing stuff
  - Importance of using true citations
  - Different ways of citin
    - The data/software itself (preferred)
    - A data/software paper from a dedicated data/software journal

> this can be done at the end or maybe as a separate checklist exercise, but please do note things down here as you go

## What to learn next
> recommended next chapters that are a good next step up

## Further reading
> top 3/5 resources to read on this topic (if they weren't licensed so we could include them above already) at the top, maybe in their own box/in bold.
> less relevant/favourite resources in case someone wants to dig into this in detail
