## Summary

Research Data Management (RDM) covers how research data can be stored, described and reused. Data here is used as a
generic term to encompass all digital objects. RDM is a key part in enabling reproducible research. RDM ensures
efficiency in research workflows, and also greater reach and impact, as data become FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable). Data should be stored in multiple locations and backed-up regularly to prevent loss or
data corruption. Clearly describing data using documentation and metadata ensures that others know how to access, use
and re-use your data, and also enable conditions for sharing and publishing data to be outlined.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful

To be able to share data that is understandable and re-usable by third parties, research data needs to be managed
properly. The FAIR principles provide guidance on how to make data discoverable and reusable. FAIR data is a key
component of reproducing an analysis. However, FAIR data is not a synonym for open data or quality data. This chapter
lays out good data management practice to allow you to plan your data management activities at the start of your
reproducible research project.

## What Is Data?

Data are all digital objects that you use and produce during your research life cycle, encompassing datasets, software,
code, workflow, models, figures, tables, images, articles. Data are your research asset. In some fields it's obvious
what data means - you have observations or results of simulations etc. However, in other fields, particularly in Social
Sciences, Humanities or Arts, you may be thinking "I don't think I have any data". A good way of thinking about what
might be classed as data that needs to be managed is to ask yourself the questions "What is the information that I need
to use and write about in my paper or book?", "What information would I need to back up my conclusions?" and "What
information is needed by a third party to understand and possibly replicate the research that I've done?". This
information is your data.

## The Research Data Lifecycle - A Model for Data Management

Research data often follows a 'lifecycle' which follows the research project as it evolves; here is a
[video](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/lifecycle.aspx) that describes it. This model provides a useful
basis on which to plan for research data management, from data creation at the start of a research project, through to
publishing and sharing research at the end of the project, and archiving any research data for the long-term and for
future re-use once the project has ended.

The research data lifecycle involves data creation, data use, data publication and sharing, data archiving and data
re-use or destruction. However, data have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them.
