# Storage and backup

Data loss can be catastrophic for your research project and can happen often. You can prevent data loss by picking
suitable storage solutions and backing your data up frequently.

## Where to store data

- Most institutions will provide a _network drive_ that you can use to store data.
- _Portable storage media_ such as memory sticks (USB sticks) are more risky and vulnerable to loss and damage.
- _Cloud storage_ provides a convenient way to store, back and up and retrieve data. You should check terms of use
  before using them for your research data.

Especially if you are handling personal or sensitive data, you need to ensure the cloud option is compliant with any
data protection rules the data is bound by. To add an additional layer of security, you should encrypt devices and/or
files where needed.

Your institution might provide local storage solutions and policies or guidelines restricting what you can use. Thus, we
recommend you familiarise yourself with your local policies and recommendations.

When you are ready to release the data to the wider community, you can also search for the appropriate
[databases and repositories](https://fairsharing.org/databases) in FAIRsharing, according to your data type, and type of
access to the data. Major
[publishers are progressively defining clearer recommendations for data deposition and sharing](https://fairsharing.org/recommendations),
endorsing specific generics as well as domain-specific databases and repositories.

## Backups

To avoid loosing your data, you should follow good backup practices.

- You should have 2 or 3 copies of your files, stored on
- at least 2 different storage media,
- in different locations.

The more important the data and the more often the datasets change, the more frequently you should back them up. If your
files take up a large amount of space and backing up all of them would be difficult or expensive, you may want to create
a set of criteria for when you back up the data. This can be part of your data management plan.
