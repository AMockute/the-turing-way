# Advantages of working reproducibly

We have so far discussed the different aspects of reproducible research that are beneficial for the scientific community. In this chapter, we will share some less obvious aspects of working reproducibly for individual researchers and teams.

![Why care about working reproducibly](../../figures/reasons_reproducibility.png)

**1. Track a complete history of your research**

Reproducible research must contain a complete history and narrative (also known as [Provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance)) of the project planning and development process. This includes information on the data, tools, methods, codes, and documentation used in the research project. By storing a complete track-record of our work, we can ensure research sustainability, fair citation/acknowledgment, and usefulness of our and others' work in our research fields.

**2. Facilitate collaboration and review process**

By designing reproducible workflows and sharing them with the different components of our research project, we can allow our collaborators to develop an in-depth understanding of our work. This encourages them to review different parts of our work, test our code, propose useful changes and make thoughtful contributions to develop our project further.

**3. Publish validated research and avoid misinformation**

Lack of reproducibility is one of the major factors that lead to paper retractions (source [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/)). The best-known analyses of scientific literatures in psychology {% cite Begley2012 %} and cancer biology {% cite aac47162015 %} found the reproducibility rates of their research output of around 40% and 10%, respectively. By working reproducibly, we can develop validated research work, avoid misinformation that can limit replicability of our work and publish accurate research outputs. This aspect does not only support the validity of the current work, but any future studies that are based on reproducible research {% cite MozillaScienceLab %}.

**4. Write your paper efficiently**

Well documented analyses help us maintain easy access to all the results generated within a project that can be written up efficiently. If working in a team, collaborators can easily get recognition such as authorship for their contributions. Furthermore, by availing the underlying dataset and methods we can easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.

**5. Get credits for your work fairly**

Researchers who use the principles of reproducibility in developing their projects publish their work with underlying data and methods. Such papers get cited more often as their research outcome can be broadly replicated and trusted.

**6. Ensure continuity of your work**

By following guidelines for reproducibility, we can easily communicate our work with different stakeholders such as our supervisors, funders, reviewers, students, and potential collaborators. This aspect of reproducibility increases the usefulness of our research by enabling others to easily build on your results, and re-use your research materials {% cite MozillaScienceLab %}. Progress of such projects can easily be tracked and continued - either by others in your laboratory, or yourself if you want to build on your own work after a longer period {% cite Markowetz2015 %}. This ensures the continuity of a research idea and can even find their applications in different contexts.

To learn about other benefits of working reproducibly on Open Research projects are covered in our [Open Research](../open_research/open_research) chapter.
