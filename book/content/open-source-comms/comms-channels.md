# Communication Channels

It's important to keep the community informed of any known bugs or upcoming features and the overall progress of the project, as well as having somewhere to field questions and feedback.
The channel(s) through which you choose to communicate with your community will have a big effect on the experience and sense of community your users will feel.

When setting up channels through which to communicate, there are some important things to consider.
How easy is it for the community to find these channels and subscribe/unsubscribe to them?
How easy is it for members of the community to find and join specific conversations they are interested in?
Will it be a "noisy" channel (for example, lots of notifications)?
If so, can users control this somehow?

Below are some properties of three very common kinds of communication channels used for software projects and whether they are recommended for the open community.
