# Communication Channels

It's important to keep the community informed of any known bugs or upcoming features and the overall progress of the project, as well as having somewhere to field questions and feedback.
The channel through which you choose to communicate with your community will have a big effect on the experience and sense of community your users will feel.

Below are some properties of three very common kinds of communication channels used for software projects and whether they are recommended for the open community.
