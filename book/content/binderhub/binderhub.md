## Summary

This chapter will discuss BinderHub, which is the cloud technology powering BinderHub.
We will cover the technologies and tools that BinderHub utilises and the resources you will need to setup your own BinderHub.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful
> why we think you should read the whole thing

## What is BinderHub?

A [BinderHub](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Cloud-based technology that can launch a repository of code (from GitHub, GitLab,...) in a browser window such that the code can be executed and interacted with.
A unique URL is generated allowing the interactive code to be easily shared.

The purpose of these Binder instances is to promote reproducibility in research projects by encouraging researchers to document their software dependencies by producing fun and interactive environments!
