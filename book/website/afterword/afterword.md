# Afterword

In a standard book design, the last part of book is known as afterword, supplement, appendix or [end matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_design#Back_matter_(end_matter))).
This part consists of components like glossary, index, bibliography and postscripts.

Following this design principle, we have included [glossary](./glossary) and [bibliography](./bibliography) of the book as the end matter of _The Turing Way_.

The community collaboration and development aspects of the book has been written into the [Community Handbook](../community-handbook/community-handbook) section of this book.
