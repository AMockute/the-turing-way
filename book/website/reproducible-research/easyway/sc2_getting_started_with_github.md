# Getting started with Github

Here, we provide step-by-step instructions to get started with GitHub.

**1. Create a Github account**

Go to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and create a new account using the sign up to Github box.

**2. Create a repository**

When you have created a new account and you are logged in, you need to create a new repository. 

A repository or repo is the online space where you store all of the documents, data and other files for your project. 

* To create the new repository, you need to click on the + sign in the top right corner (in the black band at the top of your window) and then click New repository. This will take you to a page that looks like a form. 
* You will see the name of your account and you need to fill in a repository name next to it. 
* Also - leave the box ticked for “public” (so it is open to all) and then tick the box to create a “README file”.
* Then click the green create repository button at the bottom.

This is what you should see now. The diagram below explains what all the buttons, tabs and other things do!

**3. Edit your README.md file**

You will now be in the landing page for your repository. 
There are lots of buttons and features on this page but don’t worry about these at the moment.

You will have one file in your repository now - README.md. So, the first thing you need to do is edit this file. 

This file is a Markdown file and you can see this because it has “.md” after the name of the file. 

Whatever you write in this file will be shown on the landing (top) page of your project on Github so you need to tell people all about your project. 

This is where you start to use the markdown formatting. 

You should see a box with README.md in the top left of it and then under that the name of your repo (see the diagram above labelled landing page or README.md file).

In the top right of this box is a pencil symbol that you can click to make any changes  to this file. 

You can now edit it.

* Keep it simple! When you’re working in any field, whether it’s software engineering or astrophysics, you’ll learn and use jargon – terms that have a special meaning to your field but likely won’t make sense to anyone who isn’t part of that field. Too much jargon can confuse newcomers, so use simple language and define all potentially confusing terms here.
* Share your project with others.
* Tell people how you can be contacted.

**NOTE: If you’re having trouble getting started, it’s a good idea to look at other peoples README.md files.**

If you can’t get your raw markdown content to render in the way you want, it is also a good idea to find a file that has what you want and then look at the raw file. 
You can copy and paste other people’s raw file content into your README.md file and then edit it.

Here is an example of a really well formatted README.md file: [STEMM Role Models App](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/blob/gh-pages/README.md)

If you click the link above, it will take you to their README.file. You can use this as a template for your README.md file.

* To look at the raw markdown file you need to click on the raw button (top right of the white box). 

* This takes you to the markdown raw file that is rendered into a nicely formatted README.md file when read by others on GitHub. 

* Now just copy and paste it into your README.md edit tab. You can now edit this for your project.

* Remember to check what it looks like by clicking on the preview changes tab. 

* When you have finished editing, you need to scroll down to the bottom of the page and press the green commit changes button. 

Commit is like a save button. 

Whatever changes you have made in the file will be deposited into your repository. 

It is good practice to write a commit title and a short description of what you have done in the commit changes box. 
So something like - ‘first edit of the readme file, copied template from … and edited it with the details of this project’.
This information about the commit is called a “commit message”.

You can see a list of your commits by clicking the clock symbol on your landing page or within the page for each file. 

**4. Add a license to your repository**

It is important that all of your work has a license from the very beginning or no one can reuse it. Licenses tell other researchers how they are able to reuse, modify and remix your work.
It is likely that much of your work will be documents and only some data or code. 
This means that the licenses offered on Github won’t really be the right kind for documents. 

[Creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licenses are the best to use for this purpose and the most open of these is the CC BY 4.0.

* To add a license to your repository, the first thing to do is create a LICENSE.md file.*

* To do this, click on the Add file button, and click create file. This will give you a blank file. 
* First, you need to name the file, so call it LICENSE.md. This makes it into a markdown file. 
* You can find all the creative commons licenses in the link above so copy the text of the license you want and then paste it into this file. 
* Don’t forget to press the green commit new file button at the bottom and label what you have done to describe the commit.
* You can also add the license to the bottom of your README.md file. Here is a link to a repo that you can copy to add in a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://github.com/santisoler/cc-licenses).
It has a text file for your LICENSE.md file and also a shield that you can put at the bottom of your README.md file.

You can find information about licenses in the [Licensing](../licensing) chapter of The Turing Way.
