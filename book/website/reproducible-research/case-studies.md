# Case Studies: Reproducible Research

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level

This chapter assumes familiarity with several topics covered in this [Guide to Reproducible Research]. 
The actually required skills depend on the case study since not all examples
make use of all methods covered in the guide to reproducible research.

## Summary

In this chapter a selection of case studies is presented that can be used to 
see how reproducible research methods can be used in practice. 
If you think that you might have an exampel to contribute yourself, feel free
to open an issue at [issues].

## How this will help you/ why this is useful

Learning by example can be an effective way to learn new concepts. 
Maybe you can start your personal Turing Way by adapting one of the examples 
to your needs?
