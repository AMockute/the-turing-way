# Data licenses

Similar to a software license, a data license governs what someone else can do with data that you create or own and that you make accessible to others through, for example, a data repository.
Data licenses vary based on different criteria, such as:
* Attribution to original owner
* Permission to redistribute or modify original
* Inclusion of the same license with derivatives or redistributions
As a result, accessibility to your data is affected by the data license you choose. <br>

Creative Commons provides a number of data licenses. 
Its website includes a [summary page](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) outlining all the available licenses, explained with simple visual symbols. 

## Permission Levels

The permission level provided by a Creative Commons data license can be understood from its name, which is a combination of two-letter "permission marks".
The only exception to this naming scheme is the CC0 license, which will be covered in the next section.

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>BY</th>
            <td>Creator must be credited</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>SA</th>
            <td>Derivatives or redistributions must have identical license</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>NC</th>
            <td>Only non-commerical uses are allowed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>ND</th>
            <td>No derivatives are allowed</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

For example, the CC BY-ND license specifies that users must credit the creator of the data and cannot create any derivatives.

## The CC0 license

This license serves a public dedication mechanism, where you relinquish all copyrights to your data.
This means that anyone can modify, redistribute or build on your work.
Several organizations, such as museums, governmental bodies and scientific publishers, have chosen the CC0 data license for at least part of their data.
In many instances, data repositories maintained by universities recommend the CC0 license as the default option, such as the [4TU.Centre for Research Data](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/use-4turesearchdata/archive-research-data/upload-your-data-in-our-data-archive/licencing/).
