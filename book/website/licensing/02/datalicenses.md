# Data licenses

Similar to a software licence, a data licence governs what someone else can do with data that you create or own and that you make accessible to others through, for example, a data repository.
Data licences vary based on different criteria, such as:
* Attribution to original owner
* Permission to redistribute or modify original
* Inclusion of the same licence with derivatives or redistributions

As a result, accessibility to your data is affected by the data licence you choose. <br>

Creative Commons or CC provides a number of licences that can be used with a wide variety of creations that might otherwise fall under copyright restrictions, including music, art, books and photographs.
CC licences can also be used as data licenses. 
Its website includes a [summary page](https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/) outlining all the available licences, explained with simple visual symbols. 

## Permission Levels

The permission level provided by a Creative Commons data licence can be understood from its name, which is a combination of two-letter "permission marks".
The only exception to this naming scheme is CC0, which will be introduced in the next section.

        <tr>
            <th rowspan="4">Permission Mark</th>
            <th colspan="5">What can I do with the data?</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>BY</th>
            <td>Creator must be credited</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>SA</th>
            <td>Derivatives or redistributions must have identical license</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>NC</th>
            <td>Only non-commerical uses are allowed</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>ND</th>
            <td>No derivatives are allowed</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

For example, the CC BY-ND licence specifies that users must credit the creator of the data and cannot create any derivatives.

## Dedicating your work to the public with CC0

CC0 serves as a public dedication mechanism, where you relinquish all copyrights to your data.
This means that anyone can modify, redistribute or build on your work.
Further, by using CC0, you forfeit the right to attribution.
Instead, you have to rely on academic norms such as good citation practices to be recognized as the creator.
Several organizations, such as museums, governmental bodies and scientific publishers, have chosen CC0 for access to at least part of their data.
In many instances, data repositories maintained by universities recommend CC0 as the default option, such as the [4TU.Centre for Research Data](https://researchdata.4tu.nl/en/use-4turesearchdata/archive-research-data/upload-your-data-in-our-data-archive/licencing/).
