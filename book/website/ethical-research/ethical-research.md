# Guide for Ethical Research

Data scientists make data-driven decisions that require the collection of data and model building approaches that can have serious implications for health, security, politics, society and everything associated with them.
Researchers or any kind of stakeholders in data science have an obligation to consider the ethical standards and their impact of people's lives {cite}`Loyola2020Ethics`.

In this guide, we invite discussions and guidance on the different aspects of ethics that a data scientist must consider to ensure a high level of research integrity in their work.
