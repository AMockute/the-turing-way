# Ethics and Law, Policy and Human Rights

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level
None

## Summary
Law, human rights and policy all relate to ethics, but they are not the same thing.

You should be aware of the laws and policies that apply to you and your work.
However, this is not sufficient to ensure that your work is ethical. 

Human rights provide a legal framework for protecting individuals. 
However, this framework operates at national and international level.
Ethical work should be grounded in human rights, but sometimes require more guidance to operationalise for particular contexts.

Laws and policies are made by people, and they are subject to negotiations and exercises of power: they can also be changed.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful
It's useful to know how the ethics that guide your work are underpinned by other frameworks, including law, policy, and human rights. 
Knowing the law, policy, and human rights that underpin research ethics will give you a deeper understanding of how to conduct ethical research. It can also help you to advocate for ethical work with colleagues and collaborators.

## Law

This is not legal advice. Please read for information only!

### Ethics and law

Laws are made by humans.
They reflect the outcomes of negotiations between different people, with different interests and different amounts of power.
Complying with laws is usually necessary, but *rarely sufficient*, to ensure that you are acting ethically.

### Domestic and regional law

You should be aware of what laws cover the open science work that you are doing.
This will depend on which jurisdictions you work in: usually the geographical area covered by a law.
You should be aware of the laws that cover you at local, state or regional, national, and international levels. 

You should also be aware what steps you should take to ensure that you are compliant with all relevant laws. 
This section is not exhaustive!
It is designed to give you some idea of the kinds of laws you should be aware of.

#### Data protection law

Data protection laws cover what is permitted by law when collecting and processing data. 
The aim of data protection laws is to protect the privacy of individuals when collecting and using information about them.

Data protection laws need to be updated frequently in order to make sure they cover all the ways that different actors are using new forms of technology to collect and use data in new ways. 
Because data protection laws sit at the limits of what companies - especially big tech giants - are able to do, the process of making, updating and enforcing data protection laws has become increasingly newsworthy.
For example, new pieces of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/)) in the EU have attracted a lot of attention.

Many countries have a national data protection authority, which is tasked with protecting data.
They often produce guidance on how to comply with data protection laws in their country.
Wikipedia has a [list of data protection authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_data_protection_authority) covering lots of countries.

Data protection laws are sometimes confused with privacy laws, but they are not the same thing. 

#### Privacy law

Privacy laws protect people's ability to keep themselves, or information about themselves, away from public view. 
The specific content of privacy laws varies between jurisdictions.
Laws may be general, or they may only cover certain kinds of information, sometimes referred to as 'sensitive information' or 'personally identifiable information.'
This might include, for example, medical or financial information about a person.

Privacy laws have periodically been updated to take into account new technologies, which have offered new ways for privacy to be invaded and for information about people to be shared. 
This started in the 19th century when newspapers became widespread, and is still happening as legislators try to keep up with developments in the internet and in data collection.

Privacy is sometimes confused with data protection, but it is much broader. 
For example, the right to privacy protects individuals from having blood samples taken without their permission.
It means that body searches must be done in a way that preserves the dignity of the person being searched, and that home searches must only be done to search for evidence, not for harassment.
It also makes laws that criminalise private, consensual sex between adults of the same sex unlawful (nonetheless, these laws have not yet been repealed everywhere). 
Privacy is also a human right (see below).

#### Intellectual property law

Intellectual property refers to creations that have been made by humans. 
These can include literary and artistic works, as well as inventions.
They can also include scientific works and discoveries.
Intellectual property rights aim to protect the interests of the creators of these works.

These can include: 
- copyright: covers creative works, and gives the owner the right to make copies.
- trademark: covers goods or services, and identifies them as coming from a particular provider.
- patent: covers inventions, and gives the owner the right to stop other actors from making or selling that invention.

The World Intellectual Property Organisation (the UN agency which oversees intellectual property issues) has produced FAQs on [copyright](https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/faq_copyright.html), [trademarks](https://www.wipo.int/trademarks/en/), and [patents](https://www.wipo.int/patents/en/faq_patents.html).

The extent to which any intellectual property is protected in law varies by jurisdiction, and is often time-limited.
Enforcement of intellectual property law also varies by jurisdiction. 
In general, it is the owner of the intellectual property who is responsible for enforcing their rights, for example by suing another person in court. 

You should know who owns the intellectual property you create.
In some situations, it will be you personally.
If you are employed, depending on the terms of your employment, your employer may own the intellectual property you create while you work for them. 
This may impact what you are able to do with the intellectual property you create, including the terms under which you can license it.
The relationship between intellectual property law and open source is complicated but it is not necessarily incompatible. 
<!--- Link to the activism chapter, section on advocating for open practice, when we've written it -->

If you own the intellectual property that you create, you should think carefully about how to license it. 
If you do not explicitly license your content differently, it generally falls under copyright and technically cannot be remixed without your permission. 
This can present problems for working openly!

You may use an open license to share code, or content, or both. 
There are lots of licenses designed especially for sharing broadly, and organizations like Creative Commons and the Free Software Foundation have created tools and resources to facilitate sharing of content, data and code. 
There is more information in the [Licensing](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing.html) chapter.

#### Tort law

Tort law is the branch of law which allows people who have been harmed to sue for compensation or other remedy for that harm.
Tort law varies by jurisdiction. 
It can include both harm that arises from negligence, and intentional harm. 
If you harm someone, either intentionally or negligently, you may be legally liable for the harm caused.

Acting ethically, however, usually means going beyond thinking only about legal liability. 
You should be aware of all the possible harm that your work could cause, not only what you might be legally liable for. 

#### Contract law

Contract law is the branch of law which handles how contracts - legal agreements between parties - are enforced.
You should know the terms of contracts you have signed, and what those terms mean.
You should also know which jurisdiction covers the contract you have signed (this should be in the contract). 

Ethical work can also include thinking critically about contracts.
You should think about what obligations you are signing up for when you sign a contract.
You should also think about what contractual obligations you are imposing on other people when you form a contract with them.

### How to change laws

Law is not static and unchanging. 
The law is made by humans and it can be changed by humans.
If you feel that the law in your jurisdiction works in a way that is unhelpful or damaging, consider joining efforts to change it!
Changing laws is a long-term project and can take decades. 
This section is not intended to explain how to do this: a good place to start is to find a campaigning organisation who is working on the issue, and ask them how to get involved. 
<!--- edit this to refer to the activism chapter, when we have written it --> 

## Policy

Policy is a general term for a set of ideas or principles that guide actions in particular situations.
Policies are not legally binding, but they are designed to encourage certain kinds of behaviours and discourage others.
For example, the Turing Way community agrees to abide by the policy set out in the [Code of Conduct](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coc.html).

Policies are agreed between groups of people: this can be at organisational, intra-organisational, or governmental level. 
It is useful to be aware, for example, of policies on ethical research and innovation that are set by your government, or your funding organisation.
For example, the American Statistical Association has created [ethical guidelines for statistical practice](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx).
Policies can also be set by national or international organisations.
If you are a member of a professional or academic organisation, you should be aware of the policies that cover ethical research for your profession.

Many ethical guidelines that have been produced are in the form of policy.
These can provide useful guidance. 

Because policies are the result of negotiation and agreement, they can be influenced. 
If you don't think your professional organisation's policies are strong or effective enough, you can lobby for changes as a member of that organisation.
The process for doing this will depend on the organisation.
Many companies and organisations have advocacy and lobbying staff who argue for changes in government policy that will benefit their organisation.

## Human rights

Human rights and ethics have a close relationship, but they are defined and implemented differently.

### What are human rights?

_All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights_ (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1.)

Human rights are the rights and freedoms that are inherent to every human being.
They include rights like the rights to life, to equality before the law, to freedom from discrimination, to privacy, to education, and to health. 

Human rights are _universal_: they apply to every human being, without exception.
Human rights are _inalienable_: they cannot be taken away or limited, except under very specific and defined circumstances.
Human rights are _indivisible and interdependent_: we cannot have some rights without others.

### What is human rights law?

Human rights law is made up of conventions and covenants - legal instruments - that are signed by countries. 
These instruments are legally binding: this means that all countries who sign up to them take on legal duties and obligations.
These include the obligations to: 
- **respect**: to not do anything that violates human rights; 
- **protect**: to ensure that individuals and groups do not have their human rights abused or violated;
- **fulfil**: to take action to make sure that individuals and groups are able to enjoy their human rights.

<!--- add Scriberia human rights illustration here -->

Some human rights law is made at global level, by the United Nations.
There are nine [core human rights instruments](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CoreInstruments.aspx). 
They include general instruments on civil and political rights, and on economic, social and cultural rights, as well as instruments that cover specific people, such as children or people with disabilities, or specific topics, such as torture or racial discrimination.
Each of these instruments is overseen by a committee of experts: a 'treaty body.'
Every few years, each country who has signed a human rights instrument has to report to the treaty body on how well they are implementing the treaty.
The treaty body makes recommendations on how the country can continue to improve its implementation.
The treaty bodies also periodically issue more detailed guidance on how to interpret different articles of their treaty, to help countries understand better what their obligations are.

There are also regional human rights instruments:
- [African Charter on Human and People's Rights](https://au.int/en/treaties/african-charter-human-and-peoples-rights), which covers 54 of the 55 members of the [African Union](https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2).
- [American Convention on Human Rights](http://cidh.oas.org/Basicos/English/Basic3.American%20Convention.htm), which covers 23 of the 35 members of the [Organization of American States](http://www.oas.org/en/about/member_states.asp).
- [European Convention on Human Rights](https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/005), which covers the 47 members of the [Council of Europe](https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/our-member-states).
- [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT), which covers the 27 members of the [European Union](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en)

Some countries have ratified some of the treaties that apply to them: this means that they have incorporated the content of the the treaties into their national law.
Many countries also have a national human rights institution, which independently monitors and investigates human rights violations in that country, and advises the government on implementing their obligations. 

Countries that have signed treaties have committed to implementing them.
However, the process of implementing treaties in full, so that every person in a country can enjoy all the rights in a treaty, is very long and requires lots of actions from states.
Campaigning groups, including non-governmental organisations, work to narrow the gap between what countries have promised to do, and what they have actually done so far. 
Some campaigning groups are international and work on lots of different human rights issues. 
Some work only on a small number of issues, or in a small area of the world.

### How do human rights apply to data science and research ethics?

Human rights are defined in law. 
This means in many ways they are less malleable than ethics.
The letter of human rights, and the ways that they are implemented, are agreed internationally,
A violation of human rights is a violation wherever it happens. 
This is not necessarily true of codes of ethics. 
An action that one group of people sees as ethical, may be seen as unethical by others. 
There is a wider shared understanding of what human rights means across different countries, cultures and groups of people.
There are accountability and enforcement mechanisms.
But because they are a legal framework, they are not as easily accessible, and hard to apply to the daily work of data science and research.

Human rights treaties are signed by countries: that means that ultimately, it is countries that are held responsible for violations of human rights. 
However, that does not mean that researchers and data scientists are exempt from thinking about the human rights impact of their work!

The UN has produced specific guidance for companies on how to ensure that they respect human rights: the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/big-issues/un-guiding-principles-on-business-human-rights/).
Companies should comply with these Guiding Principles.

NGOs and other campaigning organisations also produce guidance on specific areas:
- [The Toronto Declaration: Protecting the rights to equality and non-discrimination in machine learning systems](https://www.accessnow.org/the-toronto-declaration-protecting-the-rights-to-equality-and-non-discrimination-in-machine-learning-systems/)(_prepared by Amnesty International and Access Now and it has been endorsed by Human Rights Watch and Wikimedia Foundation_)

Making sure that research complies with human rights is not just about ensuring that it doesn't harm.
It can also be about doing work that is actively pro-rights. 

Researchers and data scientists should, in general ensure that they:
- **respect** human rights: this means not doing work that itself abuses human rights 
- **protect** human rights: this means trying to ensure that their work cannot be used by others to abuse human rights
- **fulfil** human rights: this means doing work that actively helps other people be able to enjoy all their human rights
