# Whistleblowing

> **Write an introduction for your subchapter here**.
> Your introduction should briefly introduce the topic of your subchapter and highlight its key ideas.
> Even though your introduction should be short and focused, you should try to explain why and how the subchapter fits the overall context of the chapter and what the reader should expect to learn from it.

<!-- 
> Each of the key ideas you talk about in the introduction should have a section of its own.
> When you mention a key idea in your introduction, remember to cross reference it to the section of your subchapter where you explain it further.
> This will be useful for people who may only want to read specific parts of your content.
> See the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html) for The Turing Way's recommendations on cross referencing.

> In this template, we assume that our subchapter has three key ideas, your subchapter may have more or less than this. 

> It may be beneficial to run your content through a grammar checker (such as Grammarly) to catch grammatical mistakes.

## Key Idea 1

> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish, however, remember to add [labels](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html) to any additional headers you create to facilitate cross-referencing.

> Remember to use the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) and Jupyter Book's [Cheat Sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html) to guide your writing.

> To include an image in your writing, use the MyST directive shown below. 
> Remember to add your image to the `figures` [folder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/book/website/figures) and use the correct path, else it will not be displayed.

> To include code blocks, simply enclose your code in three sets of backticks shown below.

```
def simple_function():
    pass
```

> To include an admonition or to highlight a block of text that exists slightly apart from the narrative of your section, use the directive shown below. Jupyter Book's [documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/content/content-blocks.html#) has other useful examples.

A **whistleblower** is a person who reports wrongdoing within an organisation to an authority.
This can be internal: reporting wrongdoing to a senior person within the organisation.
It can also be external: reporting wrongdoing to an external agency.

Whistleblowers can report different kinds of wrongdoing: this can include illegal activity, harm (or potential harm) to people inside or outside the organisation, misuse of government funds (for governmental organisations). 

<!--- I'd like to have an example here that isn't Edward Snowdon, but I can't think of an accessible case - any ideas? -->


Retaliation against whistleblowers is, unfortunately, common.
Retaliation can include firing from the organisation, or creation of an unpleasant working environment that means the whistleblower can no longer work there. 

Some countries have laws to protect whistleblowers from retaliation.
For example, the EU [Whistleblower Protection Directive](https://www.cliffordchance.com/insights/resources/blogs/regulatory-investigations-financial-crime-insights/the-new-eu-whistleblower-protection-directive-are-the-member.html) requires EU countries to have prohibitions on retaliation, as well as to ensure that companies with more than 50 workers have confidential internal reporting channels. 

Some companies have policies in place to protect whistleblowers.
This can include third-party reporting systems. 

## Blowing the whistle
If you are considering whistleblowing, make sure you are aware of what protections are - and are not - in place in your country, and in your organisation.
You may want to seek legal advice about what procedures you should follow and what measures you should take to protect yourself. (Link to legal advice disclaimer)

## Example: Whistlebowing 
In June 2020, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks went public about the [racial and gender discrimination](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/18/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-black-workers) that they faced while working at Pinterest. 
Both women, who had worked in Pinterest's policy team, alleged that they had had to fight to be paid fairly, and that they had experienced retaliation for advocating for change. Ozoma also said the company failed to protect her when a colleague sharedhalf a year of severance pay.her personal information with hate sites.
Ozoma and Banks both left their jobs and received just half a year of severance pay: a few months later, a white woman who had brought a lawsuit against Pinterest for gender discrimination received a [settlement of USD 22 million](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACZ34jVrpq4QDy88mJNelRDz8GP8aOLKVD8QSy5jN5q3mgSFYc2g7BGJpcT1jrJxwCEbRhbE0MbBZVE3Cgyj4qjvfhdvWPVTGdwez9zsIsFnRArQev8e2plH0SmtILq2TNGbgqFHuEtehiJxaDhz0yXsCSLFoU9Xl8avKyirjHYp)
Whistleblowing by Ozoma and Banks enabled people of color at the company to come forward about their experiences.
“I could not stand by and let a company get away with posting Black Lives Matter when they did not act like black lives mattered in the negotiations they had just concluded with us,” [Banks told the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/18/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-black-workers). 
“This was about integrity and not letting the company get away with painting themselves as this space for kindness and positivity when they had completely denigrated, abused, and retaliated against us.”
