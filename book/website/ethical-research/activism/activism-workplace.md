# Activism in the workplace

This sub-chapter covers ways that you can take action in your workplace. 

It covers:
- unionisation, to protect workers and working conditions
- internal policy advocacy, to change how your organisation makes internal decisions
- whistleblowing, to alert people outside your organisation to problems within it.

<!-- 
> Each of the key ideas you talk about in the introduction should have a section of its own.
> When you mention a key idea in your introduction, remember to cross reference it to the section of your subchapter where you explain it further.
> This will be useful for people who may only want to read specific parts of your content.
> See the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html) for The Turing Way's recommendations on cross referencing.

> In this template, we assume that our subchapter has three key ideas, your subchapter may have more or less than this. 

> It may be beneficial to run your content through a grammar checker (such as Grammarly) to catch grammatical mistakes.

## Unionisation

> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish, however, remember to add [labels](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html) to any additional headers you create to facilitate cross-referencing.

> Remember to use the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) and Jupyter Book's [Cheat Sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html) to guide your writing.
> The [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-citing.html) also contains _The Turing Way's_ recommendations for referencing and citation.

> To include an image in your writing, use the MyST directive shown below. 
> Remember to add your image to the `figures` [folder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/master/book/website/figures) and use the correct path, else it will not be displayed.

```{figure} ../../figures/image-name.png

> To include code blocks, simply enclose your code in three sets of backticks shown below.

```
def simple_function():
    pass
```

> To include an admonition or to highlight a block of text that exists slightly apart from the narrative of your section, use the directive shown below. Jupyter Book's [documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/content/content-blocks.html#) has other useful examples.

## Internal policy advocacy

> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish.
> Remember to use the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) and Jupyter Book's [Cheat Sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html) to guide your writing.

Internal policy advocacy is when individuals or groups associated with an organisation campaign for a change in the way that the organisation makes decisions, runs projects, chooses collaborators, develops products, or in other areas. 
It can be a really powerful tool for change, regardless of whether or not the group of people campaigning are in a union.

### Example: Google Workers & Project Maven
One example of this is Google workers campaigning against Project Maven, a contract with the US Pentagon to use AI to develop more effective drone guidance.
Google employees across the globe spoke up in internal meetings, signed petitions, made memes, and shared personal statements about why they disagreed with the contract.
Some employees even resigned.
Eventually, the leadership at Google agreed not to seek further contracts with the US Pentagon.

A basic set of steps you can take for internal policy advocacy (adapted from [guidelines](https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/how-to/how-to-run-effective-campaigns) produced by the NCVO in the UK, used under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license):
1. Define the issue
    - What is the problem that you are concerned about? 
    - Is it linked to other issues or policies? 
    Tools like [problem trees](https://www.odi.org/publications/5258-planning-tools-problem-tree-analysis) can be useful to map out what else is contributing to the problem.
    It might be the case that the policy you are worried about builds on other internal policies or problems.
    You might want to campaign against those instead.
    - Can you encapsulate the problem in a short, easy-to-understand message? 
2. Gather evidence
    - Research the issue you are campaigning about thoroughly
    - You might want to collect documentary evidence, testimonials, media coverage, academic work, about the issue
    - Put together a clear, concise argument about the problems and what you think needs to change
    - Prepare yourself to answer difficult questions about your issue, why it is real and why it is important
3. Find useful allies
    - Target people who understand your cause or have a connection to it.
    - Get in touch with organisations set up to help causes such as yours (ask for advice, access to experts).
    - Get endorsement from people who hold power in your field, or in other areas
    - Find ways to involve your colleagues, inside and outside the organisation: for example, signing a petition can be a first step
4. Know who to lobby
    - Identify your routes of influence.
    Who is in a position to make change?
    How will you reach them? 
    - Think about your own contacts: can you reach people in charge directly, or do you need to go via other people
    - Don't get disheartened at the first hurdle, lobbying is hard work!
5. Use a range of tactics
    - Emails, media coverage and a good website are all useful.
    - BUT... try a little more creativity - what would make your campaign stand out and get people talking?
    - Don't forget to assess how you're doing (number of signatures on a petition, number of times the issue is raised at an all-hands meeting

You should also think about the potential risks to you and your colleagues for speaking up. 
Many people are reluctant to engage in advocacy or lobbying in their workplace, because they risk losing their livelihoods if there is retaliation against them.
Union membership can offer some protection against this: campaigning can be done by the union as a collective, rather than by individual workers. 
Think about other things that might go wrong, or that might dissuade your colleagues from speaking up, and see if you can find a way to mitigate them.

## Whistleblowing

A **whistleblower** is a person who reports wrongdoing within an organisation to an authority.
This can be internal: reporting wrongdoing to a senior person within the organisation.
It can also be external: reporting wrongdoing to an external agency.

Whistleblowers can report different kinds of wrongdoing: this can include illegal activity, harm (or potential harm) to people inside or outside the organisation, misuse of government funds (for governmental organisations). 

Retaliation against whistleblowers is, unfortunately, common.
Retaliation can include firing from the organisation, or creation of an unpleasant working environment that means the whistleblower cannot work there any more. 

Some countries have laws to protect whistleblowers from retaliation.

Some companies have policies in place to protect whistleblowers.
This can include third-party reporting systems.

<!-- IMPORTANT!

- Use this template to create your chapter's subchapters.
- Refrain from writing very long subchapters as readers may be unwilling to read them. Rather, you should split long subchapters into smaller subchapters if necessary.
