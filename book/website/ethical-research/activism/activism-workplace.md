## Unionisation

### What is a union?

In some, but not all countries, being a member of a trade union is a protected characteristic. This means organisations are not allowed to fire people for being members (but this has not always been the case)

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union considers union membership to be sensitive data and in the same category as genetic data or data on gender. 


## How does a union help scientists and researchers? 

* Specific issues with management or your 

## What can unions do? 

* Offer support for individuals who have issues at work 
* Negotiate with management on behalf of their members over working conditions, salaries, pensions (known as collective bargaining)
* Ensure workers have a a safe environment to work in 

* Raise health & safety concerns 
* Organise members to "work to rule", where no overtime or duties outside those in formal job descriptions are undertaken 
* Go on strike, where no work is performed and workers instead "picket" their workplaces by meeting outside and encouraging others to join them  
* Input into government policy through consultation responses or lobbying (e.g. speaking to the press on an issue, writing articles, or )

## Examples of relevant unions

* University & Collges Union (UCU), United Kingdom (covers researchers, academic staff and higher grades of professional services staff in Higher Education & Further Education institutions) [website](https://www.ucu.org.uk/)
* Tech Workers Coalition, Global (organisation focused on tech workers in industry)[website](https://techworkerscoalition.org/)
* Prospect, United Kingdom (union covering scientists & engineers)[website](https://members.prospect.org.uk/our-industries/science/index)

### A Bit of History: The Association of Scientific Workers 

This was an trade union for scientists founded in the early 20th Century, which had a leading role in founding similar unions across the globe. 

From the Instagram account [@BadgesofStruggle](https://www.instagram.com/badgesofstruggle/) (text and image reproduced under CC-BY with permission from the account):

>"The union began its history as the National Union of Scientific Workers in 1918, as a result of the rapid and increased class and professional consciousness, as well as politicisation of scientists in the wake of the First World War. 
>In 1927 the name was changed to the AScW, and it continued as such until 1968 when it merged with the Association of Supervisory Staff, Executives and Technicians (ASSET) to form the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS) a precursor of MSF and ultimately Unite.

> The union was established “with an explicitly socialist platform”, and several of its leading figures were both respected scientists and active socialists and Communist Party members, such as Hyman Levy and John Desmond Bernal. Several Nobel Prize winners were members. 
> The union organised scientists and technicians in government and private sector research, and became a prominent propagandist for the expansion of publicly funded R&D as well as taking political positions regarding the ethical use of science, against the global threat of fascism, and of guiding scientific research towards peaceful ends. 
> The AScW went on to found the World Federation of Scientific Workers in 1946, an organisation which during the Cold War was accused of toeing the Soviet line, and being a communist front. 
> Ironically, in her early years as a practising chemist, Margaret Thatcher was also a AScW member."

The AScW communicated with members via branch bulletins as well as a national paper: The Scientific Worker

Internal policy advocacy is when individuals or groups associated with an organisation campaign for a change in the way that the organisation makes decisions, runs projects, chooses collaborators, develops products, or in other areas. 
It can be a really powerful tool for change, regardless of whether or not the group of people campaigning are in a union.

### Example: Google Workers & Project Maven
One example of this is Google workers campaigning against Project Maven, a contract with the US Pentagon to use AI to develop more effective drone guidance.
Google employees across the globe spoke up in internal meetings, signed petitions, made memes, and shared personal statements about why they disagreed with the contract.
Some employees even resigned.
Eventually, the leadership at Google agreed not to seek further contracts with the US Pentagon.

### How to advocate internally
A basic set of steps you can take for internal policy advocacy (adapted from [guidelines](https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/how-to/how-to-run-effective-campaigns) produced by the NCVO in the UK, used under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license):
1. Define the issue
    - What is the problem that you are concerned about? 
    - Is it linked to other issues or policies? 
    Tools like [problem trees](https://www.odi.org/publications/5258-planning-tools-problem-tree-analysis) can be useful to map out what else is contributing to the problem.
    It might be the case that the policy you are worried about builds on other internal policies or problems.
    You might want to campaign against those instead.
    - Can you encapsulate the problem in a short, easy-to-understand message? 
2. Gather evidence
    - Research the issue you are campaigning about thoroughly
    - You might want to collect documentary evidence, testimonials, media coverage, academic work, about the issue
    - Put together a clear, concise argument about the problems and what you think needs to change
    - Prepare yourself to answer difficult questions about your issue, why it is real and why it is important
3. Find useful allies
    - Target people who understand your cause or have a connection to it.
    - Get in touch with organisations set up to help causes such as yours (ask for advice, access to experts).
    - Get endorsement from people who hold power in your field, or in other areas
    - Find ways to involve your colleagues, inside and outside the organisation: for example, signing a petition can be a first step
4. Know who to lobby
    - Identify your routes of influence.
    Who is in a position to make change?
    How will you reach them? 
    - Think about your own contacts: can you reach people in charge directly, or do you need to go via other people
    - Don't get disheartened at the first hurdle, lobbying is hard work!
5. Use a range of tactics
    - Emails, media coverage and a good website are all useful.
    - BUT... try a little more creativity - what would make your campaign stand out and get people talking?
    - Don't forget to assess how you're doing (number of signatures on a petition, number of times the issue is raised at an all-hands meeting

You should also think about the potential risks to you and your colleagues for speaking up. 
Many people are reluctant to engage in advocacy or lobbying in their workplace, because they risk losing their livelihoods if there is retaliation against them.
Union membership can offer some protection against this: campaigning can be done by the union as a collective, rather than by individual workers. 
Think about other things that might go wrong, or that might dissuade your colleagues from speaking up, and see if you can find a way to mitigate them.

## Whistleblowing
<!---
> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish.
> Remember to use the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) and Jupyter Book's [Cheat Sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html) to guide your writing.

A **whistleblower** is a person who reports wrongdoing within an organisation to an authority.
This can be internal: reporting wrongdoing to a senior person within the organisation.
It can also be external: reporting wrongdoing to an external agency.

Whistleblowers can report different kinds of wrongdoing: this can include illegal activity, harm (or potential harm) to people inside or outside the organisation, misuse of government funds (for governmental organisations). 

<!--- I'd like to have an example here that isn't Edward Snowdon, but I can't think of an accessible case - any ideas? -->

Retaliation against whistleblowers is, unfortunately, common.
Retaliation can include firing from the organisation, or creation of an unpleasant working environment that means the whistleblower can no longer work there. 

Some countries have laws to protect whistleblowers from retaliation.
For example, the EU [Whistleblower Protection Directive](https://www.cliffordchance.com/insights/resources/blogs/regulatory-investigations-financial-crime-insights/the-new-eu-whistleblower-protection-directive-are-the-member.html) requires EU countries to have prohibitions on retaliation, as well as to ensure that companies with more than 50 workers have confidential internal reporting channels. 

Some companies have policies in place to protect whistleblowers.
This can include third-party reporting systems. 

### Blowing the whistle
If you are considering whistleblowing, make sure you are aware of what protections are - and are not - in place in your country, and in your organisation.
You may want to seek legal advice about what procedures you should follow and what measures you should take to protect yourself. (Link to legal advice disclaimer)
