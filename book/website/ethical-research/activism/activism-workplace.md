## Unionisation

### What is a union?

A trade union is a formalised way for workers to organise and bargain collectively at an institutional, sectoral or national level. 
A union is organised into branches which are spread geographically (for example, North London) or at an institutional level (for example, labs or departments), depending on the distribution of members and how the union works. Members of unions typically pay a monthly fee, although this is sometimes waived for certain categories of members, for example, the UK union UCU allows graduate students to join for free. 

Some members take up additional responsibilities as "reps" or "shop stewards", helping to organise the running of branches, supporting members with workplace issues, and sometimes representing the branch at a national level. Larger unions often have full-time employees to support reps and workers, who are also responsible for areas such as developing union policy, press relations, and organising any large meetings for example, annual conferences. 

In some, but not all countries, being a member of a trade union is a protected characteristic. This means organisations are not allowed to fire people for being members (but this has not always been the case). Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union considers union membership to be sensitive data and in the same category as genetic data or data on gender. 


## What can unions do? 

Unions take lots of different actions to improve working conditions for their members. 
These can be at individual, workplace, or industry level.

At an individual level, unions can:
* Offer support for individuals who have issues at work: for example, supporting individuals who have been discriminated against or bullied in their workplace
* Raise health and safety concerns about particular work areas or duties

At a workplace levels, unions can:
* Negotiate with management on behalf of their members: this is called 'collective bargaining' and can be used to improve working conditions, salaries, pensions
* Organise members to "work to rule", where no overtime or duties outside those in formal job descriptions are undertaken 
* Go on strike, where no work is performed and workers instead "picket" their workplaces by meeting outside and encouraging others to join them

At an industry level, unions can: 
* Input into government policy through consultation responses or lobbying (for example, speaking to the press on an issue, writing articles, or submitting to formal processes such as hearings)
* Organise strikes across whole industries

* Support for 
* Specific issues with management or your 

## I've never been part of a union before: where do I start?

Start by finding out if there is a union already in your workplace.
If so, there will be a person you can talk to about joining: they might be known as the union rep or steward. 

If there is not a union in your workplace, look into the unions that already exist in your area or country. 
You might be able to join one that is relevant to your industry or duties: or you might be able to join a general union that represents lots of different workers. 

To join a union, you might have to pay union fees or dues. 
These are almost always sliding scale, based on how much you earn: some unions also have free membership for people in certain positions or roles. 

Once you are a member, start by attending meetings.
You can find out what issues the union is working on. 
You can also find out how to raise issues that you are concerned about.

### A Bit of History: The Association of Scientific Workers (United Kingdom) 

This was an trade union for scientists founded in the early 20th Century, which had a leading role in founding similar unions across the globe. 

![A blue enamel badge with AScW printed on it on a wooden background](https://i.imgur.com/V0Wcgbg.jpg)


From the Instagram account [@BadgesofStruggle](https://www.instagram.com/badgesofstruggle/) (text and image reproduced under CC-BY with permission from the account):

>"The union began its history as the National Union of Scientific Workers in 1918, as a result of the rapid and increased class and professional consciousness, as well as politicisation of scientists in the wake of the First World War. 
>In 1927 the name was changed to the AScW, and it continued as such until 1968 when it merged with the Association of Supervisory Staff, Executives and Technicians (ASSET) to form the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs (ASTMS) a precursor of MSF and ultimately Unite.
> The union was established “with an explicitly socialist platform”, and several of its leading figures were both respected scientists and active socialists and Communist Party members, such as Hyman Levy and John Desmond Bernal. Several Nobel Prize winners were members. 
> The union organised scientists and technicians in government and private sector research, and became a prominent propagandist for the expansion of publicly funded R&D as well as taking political positions regarding the ethical use of science, against the global threat of fascism, and of guiding scientific research towards peaceful ends. 
> The AScW went on to found the World Federation of Scientific Workers in 1946, an organisation which during the Cold War was accused of toeing the Soviet line, and being a communist front. 
> Ironically, in her early years as a practising chemist, Margaret Thatcher was also a AScW member."


The AScW communicated with members via branch bulletins as well as a national paper: The Scientific Worker [Click here to read a copy on the Wellcome Archive](https://wellcomelibrary.org/item/b19915299#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.8157%2C-0.0826%2C2.6314%2C1.6529)

## What you can do as a union member

Unions are collective projects and they are people-powered!

### Be an active member


### Become a representative

Like any community, unions need people to take on organisational roles within the union.
These roles will vary depending on how big your union is, and what it is working in. 

Some roles might include:
* supporting other union members: for example, accompanying your colleagues to disciplinary meetings or meetings with management, to provide support and take notes
* being a union rep for a particular group of workers within your workplace: this might be a team or a department, or a group of workers doing similar roles across the workplace
* negotiating a particular issue, for example pay, pensions, or holiday entitlements, with management
* representing your workplace at larger union gatherings, for example a national meeting

The process for becoming a representative will vary depending on how your union operates.
You might need to stand for election, or be approved by a meeting of union members.

## Internal policy advocacy

<!-- > **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.

Internal policy advocacy is when individuals or groups associated with an organisation campaign for a change in the way that the organisation makes decisions, runs projects, chooses collaborators, develops products, or in other areas. 
It can be a really powerful tool for change, regardless of whether or not the group of people campaigning are in a union.

### Example: Google Workers & Project Maven
One example of this is Google workers campaigning against Project Maven, a contract with the US Pentagon to use AI to develop more effective drone guidance.
Google employees across the globe spoke up in internal meetings, signed petitions, made memes, and shared personal statements about why they disagreed with the contract.
Some employees even resigned.
Eventually, the leadership at Google agreed not to seek further contracts with the US Pentagon.

### How to advocate internally
A basic set of steps you can take for internal policy advocacy (adapted from [guidelines](https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/how-to/how-to-run-effective-campaigns) produced by the NCVO in the UK, used under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license):
1. Define the issue
    - What is the problem that you are concerned about? 
    - Is it linked to other issues or policies? 
    Tools like [problem trees](https://www.odi.org/publications/5258-planning-tools-problem-tree-analysis) can be useful to map out what else is contributing to the problem.
    It might be the case that the policy you are worried about builds on other internal policies or problems.
    You might want to campaign against those instead.
    - Can you encapsulate the problem in a short, easy-to-understand message? 
2. Gather evidence
    - Research the issue you are campaigning about thoroughly
    - You might want to collect documentary evidence, testimonials, media coverage, academic work, about the issue
    - Put together a clear, concise argument about the problems and what you think needs to change
    - Prepare yourself to answer difficult questions about your issue, why it is real and why it is important
3. Find useful allies
    - Target people who understand your cause or have a connection to it.
    - Get in touch with organisations set up to help causes such as yours (ask for advice, access to experts).
    - Get endorsement from people who hold power in your field, or in other areas
    - Find ways to involve your colleagues, inside and outside the organisation: for example, signing a petition can be a first step
4. Know who to lobby
    - Identify your routes of influence.
    Who is in a position to make change?
    How will you reach them? 
    - Think about your own contacts: can you reach people in charge directly, or do you need to go via other people
    - Don't get disheartened at the first hurdle, lobbying is hard work!
5. Use a range of tactics
    - Emails, media coverage and a good website are all useful.
    - BUT... try a little more creativity - what would make your campaign stand out and get people talking?
    - Don't forget to assess how you're doing (number of signatures on a petition, number of times the issue is raised at an all-hands meeting

You should also think about the potential risks to you and your colleagues for speaking up. 
Many people are reluctant to engage in advocacy or lobbying in their workplace, because they risk losing their livelihoods if there is retaliation against them.
Union membership can offer some protection against this: campaigning can be done by the union as a collective, rather than by individual workers. 
Think about other things that might go wrong, or that might dissuade your colleagues from speaking up, and see if you can find a way to mitigate them.

## Whistleblowing
<!---
> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish.

A **whistleblower** is a person who reports wrongdoing within an organisation to an authority.
This can be internal: reporting wrongdoing to a senior person within the organisation.
It can also be external: reporting wrongdoing to an external agency.

Whistleblowers can report different kinds of wrongdoing: this can include illegal activity, harm (or potential harm) to people inside or outside the organisation, misuse of government funds (for governmental organisations). 

<!--- I'd like to have an example here that isn't Edward Snowdon, but I can't think of an accessible case - any ideas? -->

Retaliation against whistleblowers is, unfortunately, common.
Retaliation can include firing from the organisation, or creation of an unpleasant working environment that means the whistleblower can no longer work there. 

Some countries have laws to protect whistleblowers from retaliation.
For example, the EU [Whistleblower Protection Directive](https://www.cliffordchance.com/insights/resources/blogs/regulatory-investigations-financial-crime-insights/the-new-eu-whistleblower-protection-directive-are-the-member.html) requires EU countries to have prohibitions on retaliation, as well as to ensure that companies with more than 50 workers have confidential internal reporting channels. 

Some companies have policies in place to protect whistleblowers.
This can include third-party reporting systems. 

### Blowing the whistle
If you are considering whistleblowing, make sure you are aware of what protections are - and are not - in place in your country, and in your organisation.
You may want to seek legal advice about what procedures you should follow and what measures you should take to protect yourself. (Link to legal advice disclaimer)
