# WELCOME 

We are people <Ismael, Laura, Sophia> currently developing the Ethical Research Chapter of The Turing Way and are super excited to have you here. 

Laura is a PhD student at the University of Essex, UK. 
Ismael is Ethics Research Assistant at the Alan Turing Institute.

## Vision and Goal 
Our Vision is to create a framework that supports an ethical research mindset and its practical application within a researcher-driven data science community. 
The goal is to build a community (that's you!) that feels volitionally empowered to feed forward into the further development of these ethical science practices in a virtuous cycle. 

As this chapter fits in to The Turing Way, our goal is to create a community that feels volitionally empowered to 
- use the principles and practices within the book in their own work,
- advocate for the use of these principles and practices in their research communities,
- contribute back their learnings to the chapter, 
- and grow towards leadership the further development of our ethical research community.
