## Defining Ethics

With no intention of doing justice to the vast literature that there is on moral philosophy, we can take ethics to be the branch of philosophy that seeks to distinguish right behaviours from wrong behaviours, by defining is good and evil. 
Any discussion about ethics can be long and complex. 
Nowadays, philosophers speak of three levels of discussion ([Fieser, IEP](https://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/)): metaethics, normative ethics and applied ethics. 
Roughly, metaethics questions the nature of good and evil, as well as the underlying assumptions held by different ethical frameworks. 
Normative ethics, then, provides the tools for us to create such ethical frameworks and think within them. 
Applied ethics, finally, is what is most pertinent to this guide, as we will be discussing the ins and outs of ethical and responsible research and innovation.

We begin this introductory chapter with why ethics matters to science. Then we discuss how ethical questions may come up throughout a project's life-cycle. 
Finally, we share real examples of ethical dilemmas in research.

## Why Research Ethics?

Taking ethics as a study of what behaviours are right and what behaviours are wrong highlights that it refers to *action*. 
Considering this, ethics is relevant to research insofar that researchers are acting and behaving in certain ways when conducting their work. 
Taking this definition seriously also means accepting moral philosophy as paramount in our everyday lives: ethics pertains to us all. 
Furthermore, the potential repercussions of any research project may be far greater than any individual's actions. 
To this effect, the importance of acting ethically within the academic sphere is heightened.

In practice, **the historical development of research ethics has been driven due to ethical concerns around how research has traditionally been conducted and cases of clear controversy** ([European Commission, 2010](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/textbook-on-ethics-report_en.pdf)). 
Unfortunately, this has led to there being many ethical codes for research, each regarding distinct areas of research, designed by and for different institutions, and sometimes affecting scientific work conducted within entire nations and continents. 
Therefore, researchers are right to feel overwhelmed by the diversity of rules and guidelines they face throughout their careers. 
**This book is here to facilitate broad considerations that are worth making when conducting any research project.** 
As a disclaimer, the discussion herein is by no means exhaustive or applicable to every possible project.

## Ethical considerations throughout Research Stages

One key idea that will be explored throughout this guide is that we, as scientists, cannot avoid projecting values onto the work we carry out. 
After all, we are human. Given the many decisions that one must make throughout a research project, values come to play an important role in science. 
Consider the following stages of a scientific project:

1. Idea generation and hypothesising
2. Data collection
3. Data storage and management
4. Data analysis
5. Communication of results

At each of these stages, one must make decisions. 
Values may most intuitively play a role at the stage of idea generation. After all, why does one specialise in a specific science? And why are certain questions more interesting to us? 
When possible, we try to carry out research based on our own experiences and curiosities. Idea generation may also be bound to the values of a funding body: what do they want to know and why?

At the stage of data collection, we must choose what data and how to collect it: is it readily available? 
Might we need permission to use it? What assumptions underlie the collection method? 
And then we must plan how to store it: who will have access? How will security be managed in the case of personal or otherwise sensitive information? 
Lengthy debates about privacy can pop up when considering such questions. 
At the stage of analysis, assumptions can come into play again: how accurate and methodical do we need to be? 
Which methodolgy works best given planned timescales and other resourcing constraints? 
And then we must communicate our results, relying on others to interpret us correctly and not overselling our achievements.

Science is complex and heavily reliant on the knowledge and values of scientific communities. 
This is something we should not fight but come to accept.
After all, science is conducted in a society.

## Two Case Studies

It is not hard to find historical research projects conducted in questionable ways (see Milgram's experiments) or with morally ambiguous ambitions (consider the Manhattan Project that gave birth to the atomic bomb). 
We do not expect the readers of this guide to be conducting anything nearly as dangerous as these extreme cases – and they are very extreme.
With this in mind, below are two cases of science conducted in ways that can be quetioned, not to doubt the abilities of their researchers, but to empower you to question the work you conduct and improve such work by being more considerate in your approach.

### The Hydroxychloroquine Paper Retraction

The global COVID-19 pandemic meant a new world wherein scientists had to produce research fast. 
A number of retractions were made as a consequence of what may be science trying to be too fast.
Recall the role of values in how we conduct ourselves – epidemiologists and virologists were under entirely new levels of pressure to bring about actionable information that could save lives.
One retraction occured early June from the well-renowned journal *The Lancet*.
On this occasion, the paper made assertions about alleged negative impacts of the drug hydroxychloroquine on patients with COVID-19. 
However, questions were raised about the veracity of its findings. 
To soothe any concerns, the paper's authors launched a third-party review into the database they had analysed in their research. 
However, the data provider – Surgisphere – would not make the data available to the independent review panel, as this would violate their client agreements. 
In light of this, the authors made the tough decision to retract their paper.

So what happened? 
Two moral values seem to clash in this instance. 
On the one hand, we have a global pandemic that requires knowledge to be produced to save lives. 
On the other, we have the privacy of the people who made their information available to Surgishpere. 
Given that the confidentiality with which patients' data are to be treated is paramount, Surgisphere simply couldn't give up their data. 
One issue that arises here is that of *consent*. 
In this case, the patients had not given consent for their data to be made available to this particular independent research panel for the purpose of replicating the original paper's findings. 
This is the moral value that prevailed on this occasion. 

### England's Grading Algorithm

The global COVID-19 pandemic, amongst many other things, affected the way students around the world conducted their studies and attended school. 
For the 2019-20 academic year, the UK government decided to go ahead with an algorithm that would "[maintain] standards and ensured that grades were awarded broadly in line with previous years" (Taylor, [2020[(https://www.gov.uk/government/news/statement-from-roger-taylor-chair-ofqual)). 
As it turned out, this algorithm would result in disproportionate increases to grades for students at private schools versus students from less privileged schools. 
After days of protests across the country, the government made a critical U-turn, allowing students to have the predicted grades their teachers had given them in the first place. 
There are numerous analyses online about this case, 
We would like to briefly highlight two: the need for testing, and the need to demystify the potential of data science through clearer communication. 

Firstly, this was a case of creating and immediately implementing a grade-predicting algorithm. 
Indeed, it had not been tested anywhere before (after all, the pandemic placed government officials and entire societies in unprecendented times). 
But in not testing the algorithm, there was no possibility to speak of *robustness* in any technically accurate manner (see [here](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions.html?highlight=robustness#table-of-definitions-for-reproducibility) for a definition of *robustness*). 
This also meant there was no opportunity to question underlying assumptions *before* implementing the algorithm. 

Secondly, the government had commissioned this algorithm early on in the year when it became clear that students would not be able to sit A-level exams. 
But why? 
There seems to be a form of automation bias at play here. 
That is to say that we sometimes naturally favour decisions made by machines. 
However, artificial intelligence (AI) should be taken as more limited in its capability. 
An algorithm is not something we should turn to for decisions to be made for us (especially decisions that can be so life-changing), but for data that can feed into more evidence-based decisions. 
So, rather than build an algorithm that decides the grades of thousands of children, build one that can provide more insight into how students are graded. 
But this requires a major shift in how we perceive data science. 
And we, as researchers, owe it to the public to clarify what data science can and cannot do.
