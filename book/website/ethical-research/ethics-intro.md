## Defining Ethics

With no intention of doing justice to the vast literature that there is on moral philosophy, we can take ethics to be the branch of philosophy that seeks to distinguish right behaviours from wrong behaviours, by defining is good and evil. 
Any discussion about ethics can be long and complex. 
Nowadays, philosophers speak of three levels of discussion ([Fieser, IEP](https://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/)): metaethics, normative ethics and applied ethics. 
Respectively, these refer to discussions about how different ethical theories compare, how one arrives to ethical principles, and how applies ethical considerations to specific situations. This chapter introduces the concept of ethics as applied to scientific research. 
We will begin with why ethics matters to science. Then we discuss how ethical questions may come up throughout a project's life-cycle. 
Finally, we share real examples of ethical dilemmas in research.

## Why Research Ethics?

Taking ethics as a study of what behaviours are right and what behaviours are wrong highlights that it refers to *action*. 
Considering this, ethics is relevant to research insofar that researchers are acting and behaving in certain ways when conducting their work. 
Taking this definition seriously also means accepting moral philosophy as paramount in our everyday lives: ethics pertains to us all. 
Furthermore, the potential repercussions of any research project may be far greater than any individual's actions. 
To this effect, the importance of acting ethically within the academic sphere is heightened.

In practice, **the historical development of research ethics has been driven due to ethical concerns around how research has traditionally been conducted and cases of clear controversy** ([European Commission, 2010](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/textbook-on-ethics-report_en.pdf)). 
Unfortunately, this has led to there being many ethical codes for research, each regarding distinct areas of research, designed by and for different institutions, and sometimes affecting scientific work conducted within entire nations and continents. 
Therefore, researchers are right to feel overwhelmed by the diversity of rules and guidelines they face throughout their careers. 
**This book is here to facilitate broad considerations that are worth making when conducting any research project.** 
Of course, the below discussion is by no means exhaustive or applicable to every bit of work.

## Ethical considerations throughout Research Stages

One key idea that will be explored in a later chapter is that we, as scientists, cannot avoid projecting values onto the work we carry out. 
After all, we are human. Given the many decisions that one must make throughout a research project, values come to play an important role in science. 
Consider the following stages of a scientific project:

1. Idea generation and hypothesising
2. Data collection
3. Data storage and management
4. Data analysis
5. Communication of results

At each of these stages, one must make decisions. 
The most intuitively driven by values might be the stage of idea generation: why does one specialise in a specific science? Why are certain questions more interesting to us? 
When possible, we try to carry out research based on our own experiences and curiosities. Idea generation may also be bound to the values of a funding body: what do they want to know and why?

At the stage of data collection, we must choose what data and how to collect it: is it readily available? 
Might we need permission to use it? What assumptions underlie the collection method? 
And then we must plan how to store it: who will have access? How will security be managed in the case of personal or otherwise sensitive information? 
At the stage of analysis, assumptions can come into play again: how accurate and methodical do we need to be? 
Which methodolgy works best given timescales and other resourcing constraints? 
And then we communicate our results in ways which rely on others interpreting our own interpretations of the data.

Science is complex and heavily reliant on the knowledge and values of scientific communities. 
We will elaborate on this later in section 4.
