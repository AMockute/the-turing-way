## Summary

The [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/activism) defines activism as "the use of direct and noticeable action to achieve a result, usually a political or social one". 
There are many different scenarios where scientists and researchers would engage in activism to acheive change, such as a different institutional policy on open data, increasing ethical standards of research (see the [Ethics Book](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethical-research.html)), or improving working conditions. 
Scientists may engage in activism across topics related to their work, institutions, fields, or cross-disciplinary issues such as open research, or on topics unrelated to their career. 

This chapter will cover examples of different types of activism focused on workplaces:

* *Whistleblowing* the act of alerting authorities or the press to problems in your institution  
* *Internal policy advocacy* campaigning to change the way your institution makes decisions or handles certain situations   
* *Unionisation* collective organisation of workers to improve working conditions 
 
In the future, we would like to expand this chapter to include guides to activism in wider society for scientists, for example, how to engage with government policy-making processes.

## Motivation and Background

Activism can take many forms and achieve many different things, but it's most effective when people work together as a community with a shared goal. 
However, it can be difficult to know where to start when you want to make a change.
