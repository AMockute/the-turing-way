# Labels for cross referencing

In JupyterBook, labels are a way to add tags to parts of your content or a file that you can reference later on.

We define a naming convention for labels in _The Turing Way_ to ensure that the locations of these labels in the book are identifiable by their name.

Every label created in this book is compiled in this tabel in an alphabetical order to enhance the findability and reusability of these labels by other contributors.

| Label name | File location | Chapter title |
|:---|:---|:---|
|`rr-overview-benefits`| `reproducible-research/overview/overview-benefit` | "Added Advantages" |
`rr-overview-definitions` | `reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions` | "The Turing Way definition of reproducibility" |
| `rr-overview-resources` | `reproducible-research/overview/overview-resources` | "Resources for reproducibility chapter" |
