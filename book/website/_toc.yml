# Each entry has the following schema:
#
# - title: mytitle   # Title of chapter or section
#   file: content/myfile  # file of section relative to the content/content/ folder.
#   sections:  # Contains a list of more entries that make up the chapter's sections
#
# Below are some special values that trigger specific behavior:
# - header: My Header  # Will insert a header with no link in the sidebar
#
# Jupyter-book expects the first two lines to reference to the landing page. If the
# landing page is also a section of the book, create a copy of the section file and rename 
# it as the index and add it at the beginning of the document (but don't link the 
# same file as landing page and section, this will create trouble with the structure of the
# subections)
