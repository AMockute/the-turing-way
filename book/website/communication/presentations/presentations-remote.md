# Presenting at Remote Events

Giving a talk or presenting a poster at a remote conference poses particular challenges.
Whether this occurs in a live or pre-recorded event, some factors should be paid special attention to related to the technical quality of the presentation and its accessibility.

## Visual Elements of the Presentation

A presentation for a wide audience can include photos, illustrations, graphics and icons. There are many sites from which you can obtain these types of resources for free (with attribution) or paid to use in your presentations.

Some of the websites that offer these resources for free are:

* [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) for icons and photographs
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for photographs
* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) for photographs
* [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/english) for icons and illustrations
* [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/english) for icons
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com) for icons

## Technical Set-up for Recording a Talk

Presenting a talk through a digital medium involves tackling some technical challenges, including managing video and sound accessibility and quality.

### Video Recording

* As mentioned earlier, use captions during the talk to aid accessibility.
* A useful step to ensure that people with different devices (and screens) can appreciate the video's content is to develop the presentation using your smallest screen.
* Even if you are only sharing a slide deck, seeing you on video can help your audience to keep their concentration on the presentation. You don't need the best camera or video post-processing software, but [managing your lighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGcAM1CNEU0&ab_channel=Wirecutter) will do wonders for your video quality.

### Sound Setting

* For the members of your audience who aren't hard of hearing, sound quality will always be more important than video quality.
* Before the presentation, record your voice using the same device you will be using in the presentation to check the sound quality and make any adjustments you can to ensure a crisp sound.

### Video Recording

* The simplest way to record the contents of your talk, including your video, voice and presentation, is to record it using a videoconference service (like Zoom) or recording software like [OBS](https://obsproject.com). See [this guide](https://software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/2019/application-video-guide) by the Software Sustainability Institute on how to configure OBS for screen recording.
* If you are recording your talk to present it asynchronously you can use platforms like [Amara](https://amara.org) to generate your subtitles from the video.

## What to Expect from Speaking Invitation

If you have recently published a research object (like a scientific paper, software, app, or blog), or if you are known for your expertise in your field, you likely get invited to give talks at public forums, panels and conference sessions.
It could also be something you do upon request, for example, for graduate schools where young researchers can learn from your research work or career path.
It is beneficial for your career progression as more people get to know you, learn about your work and establish collaborations.
By giving talks at different insitutions and events you can receive timely feedback on your progress and improve the quality and impact of your research.
For event organisers, inviting (relatively) known experts as speakers translates into the popularity of their events where participants are given opportunities to exchange ideas and advance their skills.

### Honoraria for Delivering a Talk

> Honoraria recognises speaker's work by recompensing for their time and expertise invested in developing and delivering a talk.

An invited talk is often expected to be delivered for free as it benefits both the organisers and the speakers.
However, it is not a fair situation for all, especially when people have personal financial needs, or if they are self funded.
Organisers need to keep in mind that developing talks takes substantial amount of time and effort, and hence, should consider offering honoraria if they can allocate a budget for that.

In some cases, honoraria may be offered to speakers for giving invited talks - this is a payment that covers the talk preparation time and any other costs such as recording hardware for virtual events, or travel and accommodation for in-person events. 
How much they are offered will vary depending on the organisation, nature of participation (such as short talk, panel discussion and seminar) and also the status of the talk, for example you might be offered more for being a keynote speaker at a large conference. 

Many academics are never offered or do not accept honoraria payments for many personal (tax, admin overhead in handling small fund, sufficient salary or personal interest in the event) or professional (their organisation policy prohibits receiving of honoraria or they donate back to the host organisation) reasons.
To have a diverse and inclusive academic community we need to be aware that not all researchers can afford to dedicate ther time on volunteer/unpaid labour or have the money to cover the cost of giving an invited talk. 
For more information about giving invited talks see the blog "[Speaking as an Academic: What to expect when you are invited to share your work](http://getalifephd.blogspot.com/2017/04/speaking-as-academic-what-to-expect.html)".
Also, see [Fix the Gap](https://500womenscientists.org/fix-the-gap) project by '500womenscientists.org' that aim to crowdsourcing speaking engagement fees & honoraria details to empower researchers to ask for compensation.

### Speaker Rider for Invited Talks

For researchers who get invited to several events, it is useful to craft a speaker rider, a framework or list of their expectations from an event where they would like deliver an invited talk.
It allows speakers to evaluate if speaking at an event aligns with their personal values, however, it has a specific role in encouraging organisers to make necessary amendments and arrangements to make sure that their event meets the speaker rider, making it attractive for experts to consider giving an invited talk. 

In open source space, [Tatiana Mac's Speaker Rider](https://gist.github.com/tatianamac/493ca668ee7f7c07a5b282f6d9132552) is highly cited and reused to make the open source events more inclusive, accessible and beneficial for the historically excluded and marginalised communities.

``` {Note} Speakers: What You Can Do

As Tatiana Mac put it in their speaker rider, speaking comes with immense privilege. Not everyone gets to be a speaker, but if you’re in a position to do so, we encourage you to use this privilege to check whether the event you’re speaking at shares your values, and/or ask that they make sure their event is a better and more inclusive space for historically marginalized communities.

Before accepting an invitation to speak, send the rider to the event organizer and ask them how many criteria they meet. Got invited to an event that you don’t actually want to speak at? Send this to them anyway and help let others know which events are truly committed to this work.
