Yanina is a researcher at [INTA in La Pampa, Argentina](https://inta.gob.ar/personas/bellini.yanina), applying data science to the agricultural sector.
She has a degree in Information Systems and a Master in Data Mining and Knowledge Management.
She is the co-founder and organizer of multiple collaborative spaces such as Metadocencia, RLadies and LatinR among others.
She has organized more than 70 events (of regional and international scope), including being general chair of the Jornadas Argentinas de Informática (2020-2021), founder and current chair of LatinR (one of the largest Latin American conferences on the use of R in research and development) and one of the global coordinators of useR! 2021.
Both in her role as a researcher and within the R community, she works to make science as reproducible and open as possible using open informatics tools.

## 1. When did you start giving talks about your research in non-academic events?

I work at [INTA](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/inta) (National Institute of Agricultural Technology), which is a scientific institution.
Our activities are organized into research & development and knowledge transfer & extension, both with the same weight and importance.
Everything that has to do with teaching, outreach, communicating, and transferring knowledge of our production to social actors in the agricultural sector and the general public is part of our work.
Within INTA, training and communication activities, whether through a course, a workshop, an article, or an interview in a newspaper, radio, or television, are important and necessary.
We only make sense if people use what we do.

## 2. What aspects do you have to take into account when thinking about an event with very interdisciplinary talks?

I think the main thing is to know your audience beforehand.
You can ask the organizers of the event to whom you are going to speak, what is their background, what is the reason they come to the event, and so on., since, in that way, you can foresee some of the expectations they are going to have and try, at least, to fulfil some of them in your talk.

Also, I start the talk with a relaxed attitude so that the audience feels that, even though I am there as an expert,
I am approachable when it comes to comments and questions.
After all, these kinds of meetings and sessions are meant for people to take something away, to learn something.

Knowing your audience and at least one or two of the things they expect from the talk is important because, by fulfilling them, they leave with something they went looking for and so it's going to contribute to the evaluation that it was worth it being there.

That is another point to take into account, respect for the other person's time and to prepare yourself in advance.
Make it clear that you care about giving a good talk, with useful information, make it clear that you want them to profit from the time they decided to spend listening to you.

Keeping time schedules is also important, both for you, the audience, and the rest of the speakers.

It is necessary to be well informed about the format of the talk: the amount of time allotted to the talk, and its structure (like you deliver your talk and questions are asked at the end or you can ask questions during the talk, how much time is given to questions, are debates and discussions expected).

In general, if there is no predefined format for the talk, I ask to be allowed to interact with the audience.
I like to ask questions and have them answer me in the chat, it makes them part of the event.
Then, I read the answers and, even though the slide is the same, what I am going to say is going to be different depending on the answers I get.

If the format is structured, I follow the instructions of the organization, which in general consists of an introduction of the speaker, the presentation, and then the questions.
Some organizers ask for the material beforehand so that the audience can go through it and send you the questions before the talk.
So you need to communicate with the organizers and understand the process.
Also, I always ask for feedback from the organizers so that I can improve the talk.

On the other hand, I try to address what was left unanswered at the event in two different ways: I make a blog post with the questions and answers (sometimes I add them on the talk’s page) or with Twitter threads.

In the same way, I strive to make the materials available before the talk and take into account accessibility issues, such as a font size that is visible, colour contrasts, including speaker's notes, a download link, a license so they know how to use it, among other details.

Thanks to R-Ladies I started to pay more attention to these kinds of details in my materials, things that I didn't pay much attention to before but can make a big difference in the use and accessibility of my talks.

## 3. What aspects of delivering these talks contribute to your professional work?

The foremost aspect is the network of contacts you gain from the events.
By attending and talking about what I’m working on has resulted in collaborations, agreements, publications, joint work, and projects.

Expanding that network of contacts can also mean that you can bring people together to work jointly.
I think it is a very important role for those of us who have been in the profession for several years to be a bridge between communities and people so that they can get to know each other.

On the other hand, it helps me to improve my talks, my materials (many of them end up in a somewhat more academic publication), and to gauge the needs, doubts, or concerns of people regarding the topic I am communicating.
That serves me as a thermometer of demand, of what people are needing; of what is not being understood; of what topics require training, books, Blogposts, or materials; to reaffirm or correct the direction of my work.
This can lead to the presentation of a new project proposal, the search for funding for that project.

Finally, you learn a lot, about other fields, about other professions, about other people and other countries.
In the events, many times you get to attend other invited speakers’ talks and you learn from them.
In addition, you learn about projects, you access information and may be presented with other possibilities for yourself or for communities you know.

## 4. Do you have any advice on things to avoid or, perhaps, to handle with care?

I think you have to be very careful with humour.
I think that this aspect works only on oneself, if I laugh at myself, then there is less risk of offending or hurting someone.

On the other hand, you have to avoid being impolite regarding schedules.
For example, if a talk lasts an hour, it would be convenient to finish it within 50 minutes and leave the participant ten minutes to stretch, get up, hydrate themselves or go to the bathroom and then continue with their routine, especially in this virtual setting where we live from one Zoom to another.

If you don't know how long it will take you, it's best to practice it beforehand in front of your pet, your family, or a community.
As you get the hang of it, you know how long the talk or concept is going to take, and whether it needs to be shortened or stretched depending on the time.

Another thing I would try to avoid is not leaving time to interact with people.
At some point, you have to interact with the people who attended the event, either during the talk, in the end, or when you feel more comfortable.
If you just deliver the talk, finish and leave, you lose the possibility of generating contacts or being approachable, which are two of the main goals of this type of event.

Regarding the materials, make sure that they are accessible.
As I mentioned before, work to make them as accessible as possible (legible fonts, contrasting sizes and colours, speaker's notes, alternative text in the images) and that they are licensed.

When I prepare a talk, when budgeting the time it takes me to put it together, I add a day or two more to check its accessibility.
The license is fundamental to let your audience know how they can reuse your material and, if they cannot reuse it, to make it clear.

Finally, a very Argentine phrase: "Don’t get up on your high horse"; deliver the talk with the peace of mind that comes from knowing your work and your discipline, but also with fitting humility.
You have to acknowledge that there may be questions that you do not know how to answer.

The same goes for language, where you can be technically correct without using complex language.
However, if you use technical terms because you have to, you have to explain them or make an analogy with everyday things.
For example, a computer program is like a recipe: you give instructions to the computer.
That is why it is key to know your audience, as then you know what to rely on when explaining more complex concepts.

We are discussing talks given at community events.
In general, I deliver them free of charge and the materials are open, but if a company invites you, don't be ashamed or afraid to charge for them in case that, later on, it will be economically profitable for whoever invites you.
I also don't pay out of my pocket if I am invited to give a talk; this means that the costs of travel or registration are paid by the organizer.
If your talks are in high demand, the organizer's handling of the costs helps you decide.
Also, you should never transfer the intellectual property of your material to the event organizer, but if they ask you to transfer it and you agree, charge them very well for it.

In my case, the talks I deliver are related to Data Science, with Agricultural Sciences and communities of practice.
If I am invited to deliver a talk as an INTA researcher, I do not charge for it either, because it is part of my job.
When I am invited to deliver a talk due to my involvement in communities of practice or for events not related to INTA, if they are for public universities, for example, organizations like R-Ladies, or free events and conferences, I accept as a way of giving back a big part of what I received.
I live in a country that allowed me to receive education in a public system that is funded by all of us, and giving this kind of training is a way of giving back.
Currently, I’m privileged enough to be able to engage in this kind of activity without charging; not everyone is, and they don't have to feel obligated to do it.

Some people have a guideline when it comes to being invited to deliver a talk, such as [Tatiana Mac](https://gist.github.com/tatianamac/493ca668ee7f7c07a5b282f6d9132552#file-tatiana-mac-speaker-rider-md), [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/talks/speaking/) and Steph Locke.

These are also questions that I take into account: Is it an all-male panel?
Does the event have a Code of Conduct?
Is it open access, or does it have benefits for less advantaged people?
Again, if one can demand these types of things in the events one is going to participate in, we will be helping to generate friendlier and safer environments.
Sometimes one does not have the possibility or the privilege to choose, so those of us who can do it.

## 5. What perspectives do you have for your future talks? What would you be interested in trying?

Lately, I have been asked to give talks on three topics: communities of practice, science and data applied to agriculture (with use cases), and science and data in geo-technology.
It is difficult to maintain the enthusiasm of always telling the same thing because, in addition, you feel like an impostor thinking about how many more times you are going to deliver the same talk.
The thing is that, sometimes, they invite you because they have seen it and want to replicate it in another setting.

What I generally do is to update the talks when I have new results or use cases and, depending on the expected audience, I explain in more detail the concepts I need them to know to get more out of the talk.

It can be noted that there is a great need to resume face-to-face activities.
I hope that virtual activities will continue because they opened up a panorama of participation (as a lecturer and as an attendee) that I did not have before; they allowed me to attend activities that would have been beyond my reach if I’d had to be there in person (Ecuador, Bolivia, USA, Africa) since I have two small children and I avoid long trips, at least until they are older.
So, without virtual events, I would not have been able to reach so many people.
We’ll see what happens, what the future holds.
I think that this year and most of next year, we will continue in the same way, at least in the (Global) South.

Regarding the tools to give courses and talks, I apply a lot of what we teach in MetaDocencia and it works very well.
I hope to continue learning; currently, I am reading a couple of books that I hope will help me: *Teaching in the Online Classroom* by Doug Lemov, *The Discussion Book* by Stephen Brookfield, and *The Programmer's Brain* by Felienne Hermans.
