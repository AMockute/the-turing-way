## Summary
In this chapter, we present information about how to communicate with wider audiences. This includes blogging, writing lay summaries, podcasting and using social media. 

These communication methods can be used to increase the breadth of the audience for your research or community. This involves translating technical scientific writing in to different formats that make your research more accessible to specialist outside of your specific discipline and the wider public.

We present here several case studies from groups and individuals that have successfully used these methods of communication. They describe how they have practically gone about doing the communication method and offer some tips for others to get started.

Lessons learnt in this chapter will enable researchers to communicate their research more clearly with wider audiences and therefore increase its overall impact.


## Motivation and Background
Research projects and communities are judged on the impact that they make. 

This is often based on academic journal articles but there is much more scope to communicate progress, results and conclusions through other streams of dissemination. 

Building a community relies on these more accessible forms of communication.

These methods can have considerable impact on the overall project in terms of gaining interest within the researchers own scientific discipline, engaging with the wider scientific community and gaining interest from the general public.
