# Communicating Research Outcome

We should present our research work accurately and responsibly to convey accurate results and avoid common misconceptions.
It is essential to demonstrate the scientific methods used in our work, but the effective presentation of the research outcome is essentially the most important component of an outreach effort.
Based on the type of audience we engage with, we can use different strategies to engage with them and ensure that they are given unbiased and correct information.

## Consequences of Poor Outreach Efforts

We can publish our results on the most viewed website or highest renowned print media, but if we fail to communicate effectively or can't convey our message accurately, the consequence can be catastrophic.
For example, genuine breakthroughs that should be followed by enthusiastic exploration and collaboration can fail to attract public attention, investors interests, or can lose funding and organisational support if not communicated well.

Over-hyped reporting of results is also damaging for science.
Speculative reporting of poorly understood information in popular media can conflate the possible impact decades worth of research can have on society.

It may be tempting for early career researchers, to make their research sound more exciting for non-domain specialists or the general public.
There may be short-term benefits in terms of funding and visibility.
However, the constant under-delivery on the over-promised conclusions can create public mistrust and question valid scientific outcomes.
The accuracy of personal data is integral in scientific reporting -
researchers should hold it to the highest standards.

WIRED have a fantastic article on [The Life-Threatening Consequences of Overhyping AI](https://www.wired.com/story/the-life-threatening-consequences-of-overhyping-ai/).
They breakdown how a popular news outlet was very selective over what they reported on from a Nature article, only giving evidence for times when the AI beat human doctors.
It is this kind of misreporting which has the potential to be dangerous and negatively affect peoples lives.

## Designing Research Project for Effective Outreach

In popular media, it is hard to always believe the latest headlines when "fake news" is rife.
With a little more care and attention given over to robustly presenting research, a cultural shift can start to take place.

There are two stages to consider when planning a research project for outreach:

### Preventative Outreach

It is about presenting so that you, and your research, can't be over-hyped or taken out of context to fuel someone else's agenda.
In other words, how to stop overhype and misconceptions.
One of the best ways to do preventative outreach is to directly address what your research *does* and *doesn't* say.
Dispel any potential misinterpretations before they happen.

### Symptomatic Outreach

It is the other side of the equation.
It is about addressing existing public misconceptions and overhype within your research.
Shying away from or ignoring current false reporting or misunderstandings of your research field is never going to fix the damage already done.
One great example of symptomatic outreach is the book "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs" by Lisa Randall from Harvard University.
Randall published a paper on "[Dark Matter as a Trigger for Periodic Comet Impacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0576)", which was picked up by the media.
However, the media only covered a small humorous aside from her research, that dark matter could have played a role in killing the dinosaurs.
Randall took this misconception and used the catchy titles of the news articles as a jumping-off point for a much broader discussion on the nature of the Universe, dark matter, the Milky Way galaxy, comets, asteroids, and impacts.

## Presenting Results Responsibly

In the next subchapter, we provide practical tips and guidelines on how to present results responsibly to accurately convey research findings and avoid common miscommunication.
