# Motivation and Background

Most of the content in the Turing Way Book is aimed at improving practices in our research to ensure that it is accessible and reproducible by other people working in the discipline.
Methods, tools and practices discussed in this book will improve the impact of our work in different research fields.
However, research impact extends beyond improving knowledge and practice by leading to improvements for society, and researchers need to be able to communicate these benefits to the public.
Unfortunately, few researchers invest significant time and effort into outreach, which often leads to an inaccurate representation of research outcome in the media, misinformation in public or important results not getting the required attention.
Research funding ultimately rests on projects having clear benefits for society, and an ability to communicate these impacts to the public and elected officials will help ensure continued funding for research in the future.

This chapter focuses on best practices for outreach and communication to ensure that our research has a broader impact outside of our immediate field.
This is a challenging task, as effectively communicating complex results to a non-expert takes practice and this skill is often not taught properly as part of the training that most researchers receive.
Ultimately, we need to use outreach as a tool for engagement with the general public and experts from different fields.
Outreach involves presenting the big picture results without necessarily going into the details that we might find interesting as a researcher, developing relationships with people that can help disseminate our research, and advocate for data literacy in general within and outside of our institution.

## Fundamental Principles

Researchers can use these principles when undertaking the responsibilities of doing outreach for their work:
1. We should present results accurately and responsibly to convey research findings and avoid common misconceptions.
2. We should communicate and coordinate effectively with different audiences in an accessible and diverse way: journalists, general public, industry, other data scientists.
3. We should approach projects with the expectation that outreach is an integral part, providing the administrative resources necessary to facilitate outreach.
4. We should develop an organic relationship with other people involved in communications and information brokering by providing training, collaborating and coordinating.
5. We should be advocates for general scientific literacy in our organisations and the public.

## Complementing Outreach with Research Work

The reasons for doing outreach are various, from career enhancement, skills development to the pure joy of sharing knowledge.
No matter the reason, here are a few ways one can complement their research cycle with outreach activities:

* Help the public gain a general understanding of scientific concepts and inspire the next generations to pursue a career in research.
* Outreach activities can help convince the public that your research matters and why governments (and hence the taxpayer) should support it {cite}`Ranganathan2013Outreach`.
* The effort of explaining your research in simple terms forces you to see the big picture and decide what is important.
This exercise of abstraction can positively impact the view of your work as a researcher.
Furthermore, outreach is an excellent opportunity to practice and improve your communication skills.
This is particularly valuable for early career researchers, as advancing your career depends on convincing others that you can deliver impactful research {cite}`UniBath2019Outreach`.
* Participating in outreach activities can raise researchers' profiles and improve career opportunities.
* There is a crisis of public trust in science, with very vocal anti-science movements in debates around high profile issues such as vaccines {cite}`BBCNews2015antivax`, climate change {cite}`Feder2012climate`, and other fields involving expert knowledge {cite}`LSE2019trustcrisis`.
It is our duty as researchers to fight misinformation by making our research approachable and understandable to the public.

We hope that the material described in this chapter will help you become an advocate for your research and ensure that your work has a maximal impact.
