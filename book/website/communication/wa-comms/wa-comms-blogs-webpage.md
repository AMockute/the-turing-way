# Building a webpage for a blog

Making a website for a blog is easier than you think so don't be put off if you have never made one before. 

You need to consider:
* **Skill level** - this is important but all of these options below can be easily learnt by anyone that regularly uses a computer.
* **Budget** - there are plenty of free options for websites but you can pay for certain services such as different themes.
* **Time** - It does take time to initially build the website and get it into the state that you want. Therefore, consider using the tool that will be least time consuming for you to build and maintain.

## Simple website construction - non-coding options
* **Wordpress**
    * Very popular site to use for blogs.
    * You can start a blog for free but added functions will cost you.
    * Simple to set up as built in easy block-like fashion.
    * Here's a [link](https://wordpress.com/) for help.
    * This is worth a read: https://www.podcastinsights.com/start-a-wordpress-blog/
* **Google sites** 
    - It says it is not set up for blogs but can be adapted for this purpose or used as a project website with blog-type updates.
    - It's free as part of the free Google docs Suite.
    - You can pay for business accounts through Google workspace for more options.
    - It has an accessible interface much like google slides that is easy to use and publish as a website.

Here is a link comparing the two simple options: https://superbwebsitebuilders.com/google-sites-vs-wordpress/

There are other options out there and you can always pay for someone to build it for you but that is a less accessible option for you. 

And it's always worth making the effort to learn a new skill.


## More advanced website building - some programming skills needed
* **Github pages** 
    * If you know how to set up a Github repository then this is an open source way to create and maintain a webpage.
    * Free to convert your repository into webpages.
    * You can select from various free themes using [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
    * This is a good resource to learn how to make github pages - [Collaborative Github Docs](https://cassgvp.github.io/github-for-collaborative-documentation/docs/tut/4-2-Make-your-Pages-site.html).
