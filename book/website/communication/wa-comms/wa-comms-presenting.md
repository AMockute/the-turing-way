# Presenting posters and conference talks outside of your immediate discipline

Much like writing lay summaries and blogs, presentation of your work at conferences that are not within your immediate research environment need to be carefully thought through.

The same principles apply here: know your audience, adapt your style and generally make your writing/talk less technical in terms of the language.

In addition to these points, to increase the accessibility and findability of your presentations it is a good idea to:
* During the talk, use captions to aid accessibility.
* Record the talk and add this link onto the presentation when shared.
* Add talk notes to the presentation (this can be done in a powerpoint file) or have them in a separate file to be shared. You could also write a blog post based on your talk.
* Put the conference slides in an open repositories, such as Open Science Framework or Zenodo, with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and advertise this on social media. Posters can also be put in open repositories.
* Put this DOI link on your presentation.
* Use academic social media, such as ResearchGate or Academia, in addition to an open repository as this can help to disseminate your work further.

## Presenting at remote events
Giving a talk or presenting a poster at a remote conference poses particular challenges. Whether this occurs in a live or pre-recorded event, there are some factors that should be paid special attention related to the technical quality of the presentation and its accessibility.

### Working on the visual elements of the presentation
A presentation for a wide audience can include photos, illustrations, graphics and icons. There are many sites from which you can obtain these types of resources for free (with attribution) or paid to use in your presentations. 

Some of the websites that offer these resources for free are:

* [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) for icons and photographs
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) for photographs
* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) for photographs
* [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/english) for icons and illustrations
* [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/english) for icons
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com) for icons

## Working on the technical aspects of the talk
Presenting a talk through a digital medium involves tackling some technical challenges, including managing video and sound accessibility and quality.

### Video
* As mentioned earlier, use captions during the talk to aid accessibility. 
* A useful step to ensure that people with different devices (and screens) can appreciate the video's content is to develop the presentation using your smallest screen.
* Even if you are only sharing a slide deck, seeing you on video can help your audience to keep their concentration on the presentation. You don't need the best camera or video post-processing software, but [managing your lighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGcAM1CNEU0&ab_channel=Wirecutter) will do wonders for your video quality.

### Sound
* For the members of your audience who aren't hard of hearing, sound quality will always be more important than video quality. 
* Before the presentation, record your voice using the same device you will be using in the presentation to check the sound quality and make any adjustments you can to ensure a crisp sound.

### Recording a talk
* The simplest way to record the contents of your talk, including your video, voice and presentation, is to record it using a videoconference service (like Zoom) or a recording software like [OBS](https://obsproject.com). See [this guide](https://software.ac.uk/fellowship-programme/2019/application-video-guide) by the Software Sustainability Institute on how to configure OBS for screen recording.
* If you are recording your talk to present it asynchronously you can use platforms like [Amara](https://amara.org) to generate your subtitles from the video.
