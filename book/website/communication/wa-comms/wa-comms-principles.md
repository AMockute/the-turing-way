# Principles of communicating with wider audiences

Researchers should consider communicating their research in a less technical manner to expand its accessibility to wider audiences. This will increase the impact of the research to different academic disciplines and also to non-specialist audiences.

You need to think carefully about the readability of any written or spoken communications. 


## Main points to consider:

* **Identify your audience** - It is important to first establish the audience that you want to communicate with as this will determine the level of readability and therefore the level of technical language that you can use.
    * To assess and organise the characteristics of your audiences, you can use a persona creation tool like the one referenced in the [Guide for Project Design](./project-design/persona). 
    * Keep in mind that there are usually many different audiences that consume at the same time the content that you publish in each of the media that we'll cover in this chapter.
* **Change your style** - Academic writing is often very formal and uses a lot of passive voice such as 'the authors suggest ...'. This style does not suit a non-academic audience and therefore your writing needs to be adapted to suit the audience you are aiming for.
* **Make it accessible** - As well as making the technical level of your writing lower, you also need to get rid of any commonly used abbreviations used in your discipline or at least make sure that you explain them. Each discipline has its own acronyms that even other scientific fields do not understand. There are also issues concerning different audiences being physically able to access the output that must be considered. Removing as many barriers to the research communication as possible will increase its effectiveness.
    

## How to make your communications more accessible

Accessibility of your writing or presentation is more than just about the technical level. How it can be accessed in terms of where it is located, the format of text and diagrams, the language and overall FAIRness of the communication all need to be considered.

* **Where you communicate** - Where your research is communicated and how much it costs will have an impact on its accessibility. 
Most communications to wider audiences will be free to access as they will be distributed online, which makes them even more impactful. 
However, many scientific articles are not accessible even to researchers because they are behind paywalls. 
This is also the case for academic books that cost large amounts compared to popular novels. 

Conference and workshop fees can exclude some researchers and you may not have control over this, therefore, putting your conference presentations and posters on an open repository will widen their accessibility. You may also consider recording your presentations and making them available online.

If you are organising an event, you can make an effort to reduce the costs or offer grants to certain individuals. You can try to make your outputs freely available by publishing them in an online repository such as Zenodo, Figshare or Open Science Framework. 
This will allow your content to be accessed by a larger audience and consequently, have greater impact.

* **Accessibility for those with disabilities** - 

You need to consider how those with disabilities can fully access your communications. 
Often the text in academic publications is accessible but the images and figures are not.  
The colour of images needs to be considered for people with colour blindness and it is a must to include alternative text for all images. Also consider what format is best for screen readers.

There are features you can use within most word processing and presentation software that can help you to edit your documents in this manner. These include being able to add alt text to any images, using the specific headings to help a screen reader move to different sections, 

Microsoft Office has an accessibility checker so you can easily run this feature when your document or presentation is completed and make adjustments. 
    
   * For more information about accessibility see [Ability Net](https://abilitynet.org.uk/) and their [guide to creating accessible documents](https://abilitynet.org.uk/factsheets/creating-accessible-documents-0). 
   * There is also a useful blog about alternative text : https://abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/five-golden-rules-compliant-alt-text

* **Language translation** - English is considered the academic language but we should be careful to make sure that all our outputs are accessible in this language. Not everyone has the same level of English therefore outputs should be written in a straigtforward manner to make them more accessible to those with English as a second language. 
    * However, not all communications should be in English. Researchers need to consider the wider audience of their communications. There may be a specific community with another language that needs to be engaged fully in the research and therefore communications should be translated. 
    * Global research communities should also consider translating key documents into additional languages as has been done for our project [README file](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/README.md).

* **FAIR resources** - It is worth considering applying the FAIR principles to all the science communications that you deposit in open repositories, such as conference presentations and posters, as this will make them more sustainable. 
    * Tips to apply the FAIR principles to training materials by Garcia et al (2020) can be easily adapted for this purpose and this is discussed in more detail here (guide to collaboration - info about collaborative tools).
