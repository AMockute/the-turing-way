# Guide for Communication


Data analysis process, statistics and project development can be overwhelming to explain to people, especially when they are not already involved in this process.
Therefore, Data scientists should not only have a good understanding of data analysis techniques but also develop skills to communicate insights from their work in a clear and accessible format that can help key stakeholders make meaningful decisions.
There are many ways we can convey our insights responsibly that can resonate with and impact our target audience.

In this guide, we welcome contributions to developing chapters and guidance on effectively communicating the data-driven outcome to different audience types who may or may not be aware of scientific data analytics.
