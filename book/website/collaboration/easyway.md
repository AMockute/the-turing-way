## Summary

This chapter introduces a simple way to access an online web interface called Github for researchers who are novices when it comes to computer coding. 

Many of the new tools developed for reproducible research can seem daunting to researchers who have little or no experience of computer coding. 

However, if researchers have used online tools such as Google workspace and Microsoft office, with a small amount of instruction they should be able to learn to use GitHub online platform fairly easily.
