#### Diversity in Leadership

Data Science project will be strethen by globally diverse team members.

As a leader it is key to keep an open mind to cultural differences and communicate clearly and welcoming what each person perceives is welcoming.

Being kind, examining assumptions, and keeping an open mind are key to be a good leader.

People in your team, group, organization, or event shouldn't feel like they have to speak too loudly to be listened to.
