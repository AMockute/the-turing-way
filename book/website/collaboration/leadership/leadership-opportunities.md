## Nurturing the next leaders

Nurture a group of people from different backgrounds and level around you that will lead the same project after a reasonable period of time.

They will also be a trusted source of changes and updates in all domains of data science.

When you are too busy leading, you may run out of time to learn about the newest thing around both at a technical and human level.

Your team will keep you from different types of blind spots and allow the projects you lead to transform accordingly.

Blind spots are particularly challenging in multicultural, sometimes even globally distributed, teams.

## Offboarding gracefully

Offboarding leaders gracefully, maybe with a guide, so they can step down if needed.
Give the opportunity to leaders to step down before they burn out.
