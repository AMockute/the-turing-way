# Open and healthy leadership

Open leadership is "a set of principles, practices, and skills people can use to mobilize their communities to solve shared problems and achieve shared goals" (See [Mozilla Open Leadership framework](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-framework/framework/#open-leadership-framework)).

By healthy leadership, we mean guidance that stewards a community, project, or organization where everyone feels safe, welcome, and valued.

## Open Leadership Framework

Mozilla's Open Leadership Framework states that leadership is about involving members and mobilizing communities to solve problems and achieve goals that are beneficial for everyone. 
Individuals who lead their work (e.g., project, organization, communication, resources) openly design different aspects of their work to promote openness and social good throughout their work life cycle.

The key principles of openness are: **design**, **build**, and **empower** for **understanding**, **sharing**, and **participation and inclusion**.

> -   **Design:** You plan projects for contributors and users’ specific needs and capacities.
> -   **Build:** You create systems and solutions that maximize a project’s clarity, usability, and inclusiveness.
> -   **Empower:** You help contributors own the work through transparency, accountability, and shared decision-making.

The emphasis is on ensuring that the members of an open project understand the project so well that the project can run without leaders because all the members are empowered to take on leadership tasks.

_The Turing Way_ is built upon Open Leadership principles, which involve and support its members to apply these principles when developing content for its book or supporting its community.

## Aspects of healthy leadership

Not all leaderships can be open, but they can apply most of the open leadership principles to build a healthy community that aims to involve and empower its members.

The following are some aspects that contribute to building healthy leadership.

- **Leading by example**: Healthy leadership leads by example. It means that leaders are the first to start doing what needs to be done and give others space to follow and work alongside them rather than telling others what to do.

- **Selflessness**: Healthy leadership prioritizes the greatest good for most, even when it goes against their benefit. Healthy leadership is selfless.

- **Consensus**: Healthy leadership acts on as much consensus as possible, even when the person/s leading do not agree with the decision of most. This aspect requires explaining the way leaders make decisions.

Sometimes it will require that leaders reach out personally to the people who were left out of the consensus to understand the whole picture best and make the best decisions for the maximum number of persons.

- **Transparency and accountability**: Healthy leadership makes decisions as transparent as possible and requires to be accountable to the people led.

- **Inside out knowledge of projects**: Deep knowledge of the organization, team, or project they lead is integral to healthy leadership.  

To avoid arbitrary decision making, one must be familiar with the whole system. 

- **Open mindset**: Healthy leadership keeps an open mind to avoid personal biases and listens to everyone to learn about changes and transformations as time goes by. Mainly when they necessarily grew apart from some aspects of an organization or project.

- **Trust**: Healthy leadership trusts people around them and is very good at identifying the best fit for different roles, sometimes even before the person themselves.
