# Open and Healthy Leadership

By healthy leadership we mean, a leadership that stewards a community, project, or organization where everyone feels safe, welcome and valued.

Open Leadership, is "a set of principles, practices, and skills people can use to mobilize their communities to solve shared problems and achieve shared goals" (See [Mozilla open leadership framework](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-framework/framework/#open-leadership-framework)).

## Open Leadership Framework

The Mozilla's Open Leadership Framework states that the leadership is about involving members and mobilizing communities to solve problems and achieve goals that are beneficial for everyone.
Individuals leading their work (project, organisation, communication, or resources) openly, design different aspects of their work to promote openness and social good throughout the life cycle of their work.

The key principles of openness are: **design**, **build**, and **empower** for **understanding**, **sharing**, and **participation and inclusion**.

> -   **Design:** You plan projects for contributors and users’ specific needs and capacities.
> -   **Build:** You create systems and solutions that maximize a project’s clarity, usability, and inclusiveness.
> -   **Empower:** You help contributors own the work through transparency, accountability, and shared decision-making.

The emphasis is on ensuring that the members of an open project understand the project so well that the project can run without the leaders, because all the members are empowered to take on leadership tasks.

_The Turing Way_ is built upon Open Leadership principles, which involves and supports its members to apply these principles when developing contents for its book or supporting its community.
