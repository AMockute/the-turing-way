# Important Features of Leadership

Leaders are individuals, who empowers others to identify solutions and make their own decisions to address challenges they face.
[Monica Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Cox), an awardee of Purdue University's Faculty Award of Excellent for Leadership once called leadership as "the highest way of activism" ([reference](https://twitter.com/DrMonicaCox/status/1299346141386022913)).
Her statement points to the leadership skill of involving the members of a group (that a leader aims to impact) in decision-making processes and not taking individual decision for them ([reference](https://www.management-issues.com/opinion/6087/the-leader-as-activist/#:~:text=But%20when%20they%20use%20constructive,in%2Da%2Dlifetime%20act.)).

With this basic understanding of leadership, in contrast to a management, in this subchapter we discuss some important features of leadership.
