# Guidelines for Remote Collaboration

In this context, guidelines are a set of rules or protocols that can create a common ground for everyone to communicate and exchange information within a distributed team for an effective and successful collaboration.

The main idea is to set a clear guideline around expectations on communication tools, etiquettes for online meetings, tasks, timelines and schedule in advance for the remote and distributed collaborative working arrangement in a team or community.

## Mode of communication and collaboration
<!---Add details and more points point to other chapters for details--->

This should provide details regarding:
- tools/software used for joining/attending the online calls
- recommendations for equipments that can provide participants with the experience as expected by the organisers
- measures have been kept in place to keep interactions and data exchange secure
- how can participants gain access to these resources and tool
- ways to improve visibility and accessibility for these tools
For a list of collaborative tools see {ref}`this subchapter<cl-remote-collab-tools>`.

## Different ways for informal interactions
<!---Add details and more points point to other chapters for details--->
Informal interactions are instrumental for ensuring full engagements of your participants, therefore provide ways for:
- encouraging casual team conversations between meetings by setting some pre-planned social discussion/interaction plans
- helping people from different time zones to catch up and build a sense of belonging (for example by shared notes, or summary emails)

## Sharing data, resources and documentation
<!---Add details and more points point to other chapters for details--->
Put together some recommendations and guidelines for sharing data (research data, personal information), resources (tools and equipments) and documentation (policies, manuals).
These recommendations should include:
- preferred platform for sharing research data (published and unpublished)
  - decide on the most appropriate way to share data, documents, analysis scripts, such as by providing shared drives and repositories on GitHub or other similar platforms
- way to protect sensitive information such as data and password
- manuals and training for setting up account and maintaining access
- locations of different documents from the organisation that are easy to find
- helpdeskl or support for setup and troubleshooting

## Planning meetings, scheduling, and agenda
<!---Add details and more points point to other chapters for details--->
Establish key tasks and milestones at beginning of project to determine how meetings will be planned, scheduled and organised.
- Decide on the frequency of your meeting and set a protocol
- Once a protocol has been established, circulate and review within the team to ensure a common understanding of tasks and goals
- Scheduling meetings that are effective across time zones, have a regular time slot and send out calendar invites to avoid confusions
- Invite everyone's input in collecting agenda points
- If a team is big, split between sub project groups to create stronger network
- Rotating schedule for chairs and note takers from the team

## Etiquette for online meetings and communications
<!---Add details and more points point to other chapters for details--->
It is extremely crucial that your participants know how they are expected to participate in a meeting.
This include details on how they can contribute to an ongoing discussion (raise hand physically, or use a feature in your call hosting software), how they can share thoughts if they don't feel comfortable talking, or how they can help create an overall welcoming environment.
- Establish format of communication within whole group and subgroups
  - Communicate clearly which tool they will use, for example, Zoom for call, Google Docs for documentation, Trello for action points
- Pre-defined agenda with an allocated chair and note taker to prevent informality and loss of focus
- Pre-communicate guidelines for creating safe space for inclusive interactions online
  - Muting microphone when not talking
  - Keeping video camera on when in a closed meeting
  - Give option to switch off the video if the call is being recorded
  - Share tips on how to 'raise hand' to participate in a discussion, on chat, physically, or using emoji
  - Send out guideline for speakers, chairs, note takers and people with different responsibility
- Joining and leaving a meeting
  - Is there a particular rule for joining late or leaving early?
- Maintaining flexibility and reducing formality
  - This is particularly useful for people who are working from home and will have their family members and pets around

## Follow up emails and communications for creating accountability
<!---Add details and more points point to other chapters for details--->
Following up with the participants after the meeting is a good way to both share the key messages from the meeting, action points that have been created for different people and to ask for feedback when needed.
- Make sure that everyone knows what their role and responsibilities are
- Follow up with teams and individuals on a regular basis
  - This should be done with an intention to celebrate success rather than micromanaging

## A few more tips for keeping the team engaged
<!---Add details and more points point to other chapters for details--->
- Set the leadership responsibility clearly (host, note-taker, gatekeeper and technical support)
- Mode of engagement that are suitable for both introverts or extroverts
- Creating opportunity for skill-building and training beyond work
- Scheduling informal meetings like virtual coffees and online games
