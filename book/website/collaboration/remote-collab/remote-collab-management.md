# Managing Distributed Teams

In the {ref}`cl-new-community` and {ref}`cl-leadership` chapters, We have already discussed in-depth on how we can manage a new online community and build healthy leadership for a team.
Therefore, in this subchapter, we have listed a few reminders of tasks that are specifically important for managing distributed teams.

- Set clear expectations for the team members about the project and their roles and responsibilities.
- Establish all modes of communication and resources according to the team's requirements.
- Develop and maintain all the required documentation such as organisation's policies, participation guidelines, project charter and information of other team members.
- Make all these resources available for all members through a central information repository.
- Respect time differences when dealing with members across different time zones when assigning tasks and allow a degree of flexibility.
- Schedule team meetings to allow everyone to share what they are working on, invite contribution and support and connect with each other.
- Provide an agenda with a shared note before the meeting and share minutes (and video recording when possible) to make sure that everyone is up-to-date, even those who couldn't attend the meeting.
- Schedule regular one-on-one meetings to ensure that your team members can check-in, align ideas as per the project's requirement and get acknowledged for their work.
- Encourage and embrace diversity and a culture of collaboration.
