# Tools for Remote Collaboration

<!---Add a few sentences capturing the concepts explained below--->
Here is a list of recommended tools for facilitating different aspects of remote collaboration discussed in the earlier subchapter.

## Finding a common availability

Meeting scheduling platforms help find a common availability without having to check with all the intended participant's back-and-forths. 
Here are some commonly used options:

- [Doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/)
- [when2meet.com](https://www.when2meet.com/)

See more options [here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-meeting-scheduler-apps/)

## Creating shared notes 

A document that can be edited collaboratively in real-time allows all attendees to participate equitably during the online call. 
This is especially important for creating an opportunity for those who can not (or do not feel comfortable to) actively speak up in group meetings.

- [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/): Etherpad is an Open Source customisable online editor.
- [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/): HackMD an online collaborative document that can be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format.

## Maintaining shared notes 

As important it is to create shared notes, it's important to save them to share with others or refer back to later. 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/free-trial/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product): Platforms for hosting, sharing and collaborating on documents and software with version control system (see [this post for detail/difference](https://stackshare.io/stackups/bitbucket-vs-github-vs-gitlab)).

Effective event registration is the first place to get to know who will attend your event.

## Hosting online calls
