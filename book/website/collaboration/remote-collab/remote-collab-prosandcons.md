# Perceived Pros and Cons

*Light opinions on people's experience with remote collaboration*

## Pros

- Remote collaboration dramatically improves the life quality of those who cannot comfortably travel or afford to live close to their office.
  - It has a positive impact on the environment by reducing travel-related CO2 emissions.
- A well-established format works equally well for low resource environments as the overall organisational cost can be reduced by not having to deal with the on-site expense.
- Distributed team format attracts people from different time zones, different workplace requirements or those who work best with flexible working hour arrangements.
- This can lead to innovative ways to establish social interactions and social dynamics in general.
- It will help us learn about more colleagues from different parts of the world and educate us more about our cultural differences and accommodations to make in our work environment.
- Decision making will become more efficient by involving all stakeholders irrespective of their locations, given the meeting is done at a mutually convenient time.

## Cons

- Developing camaraderie may be challenging as we are used to developing this in-person.
- The boundaries between working life and personal life become more blurred.
- If running an online meeting, the allocated time might not be enough to arrive at a conclusion and may sometime lead to misinterpretation of decisions made by the team.
- Conflict resolution may be difficult if most interactions happen in an allocated time slot.
- Sometimes such interactions may lack body language or tone (online chat) and may lead to misunderstanding or unnecessary conflict.
- May lose the possibility of chanced interaction or water-cooler-effects and innovative ideas that they produce.
- People will have different working conditions, for example, limited access to hardware that can lead to wrong assumptions regarding replication of certain task.
- May be distracting if working from a busy co-working space or home without a sufficient arrangement for work that can make it difficult for some people to focus and have disciplined work practices.
