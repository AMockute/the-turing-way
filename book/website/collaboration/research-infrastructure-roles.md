# Research Infrastructure Roles: Introduction

It is rare that successful collaborations occur without a person, or group of people, taking on the work of structuring participants interactions, facilitating work, and supporting the impact of the project. 
These people may be either volunteers or paid, depending on a project's funding, size, length, and number of organisations involved. 
They're called research-adjacent roles because the work they perform is not directly research, but supports the work of researchers.
The specifics of these roles will vary but can include handling administrative work, managing data storage, stakeholder engagement, community management, communications, events coordination, and a lot more.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for this chapter. 


(cl-extraresearcher-roles-summary)=
## Summary


We are planning future chapters exploring different types of research adjacent roles in more detail. 
We invite anyone who works in a research adjacent role to share their experiences as a case study.

## Motivation and Background

Without research adjacent roles, a lot of projects would never succeed! 
But this work is often hidden and not visible in academia, where papers and citations are the primary "reputation currency".
