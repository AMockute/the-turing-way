# _The Turing Way_ Newsletters

_The Turing Way_ team release newsletters every month (on the third week) to share monthly update with the community and beyond.
These newsletter include event announcements, updates from the project, celebrations in the community, useful resources for new and existing contributors, promotion of any ongoing efforts, impact stories of long standing members and shout outs to relevant other online activities.

While we send our newsletters by email to our subscribed memebrs, we simultaneously publish them online on [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/archive) so that anyone outside the community can also learn about the project.

The main motivations to draft these newsletters are following:
1. Reflect on the team's and community's project goals and any important milstones achieved in last month
2. Highlight and celebrate ongoing work and notable efforts of the community members and document them
3. Share about any upcoming events and opportunities for our members
4. Maintain ongoing connections with the subscribed members

Currently, Malvika Sharan, community manager, drafts these newsletters that are proofread and published by Kirstie Whitaker, project lead.
Some of our earlier newsletters have been written in published by Patricia Heterich and Kirstie Whitaker.

In this chapter, we share the process we have established in _The Turing Way_ for collecting newsletter items, drafting the newsletter, documentating any additional updates supplemented by community members and publishing them through TinyLetter.
