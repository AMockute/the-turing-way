# Community Coworking Calls

The concept of coworking is generally associated with the practice of sharing physical office space with different people who work independently such as the remote employees or freelancers.
This allows people, who otherwise may feel isolated while working alone at home, to use traditional office setups, create a work routine, and build a sense of companionship with others who they share their office spaces with.

We bring this practice to _The Turing Way_ online coworking calls intending to develop a sense of energy and inspiration of in-person interactions, without the time and travel commitments.

_The Turing Way_ community is distributed around the world.
Our members are from diverse backgrounds, different skills and interests, working many different jobs, and contribute to this project for a great variety of reasons.
They are also, for the most part, unpaid to contribute to this open source project.

Our coworking calls can provide opportunities for those member to allocate time to their desired tasks in _The Turing Way_ and get them done, partially or fully, with the support of others in the call who can help discuss their plans, share ideas or hold accountability.

In this chapter, you will learn about the motivation behind holding coworking calls, techniques we use for making these calls effective, our call formats, and the two types of coworking calls we host: {ref}`Collaboration Cafes <ch-coworking-collabcafe>` and {ref}`Daily Coworking<ch-coworking-daily>`.

We want to make the Collaboration Cafes as useful as possible for as many people as possible.
Please [let the team members know](/README.md#get-in-touch) if there are other ways we can make these calls more welcoming and helpful for you.
