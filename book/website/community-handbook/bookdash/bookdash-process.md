## Pre-dash drop-in calls

We hosted 2 pre-dash drop-in calls a week before the main event to ensure that all our participants were familiar with project, the format of the book dash and how they can be contributing through their involvement at this event.
It was an opportunity for us to get to know our attendees and address their questions prior to the book dash.

Several participants shared their contribution plans and topics they would like to add in _The Turing Way_ that is either missing in the existing chapters or need to be updated.
We also discussed the project expansion plans, which in addition to the book on reproducibility, will include 5 more volumes on ethics, project design, collaboration, communication & outreach and a meta-book on the project itself.

## Pre-dash brainstorming and dinner

Our participants joined us in London on 20 February 2020 at The Alan Turing Institute for an introduction session.

To everyone's delight, many participants brought their local sweets and snacks to share with other attendees - which was a huge highlight of the day (and might become a book dash ritual!). Beyond sweets, [Barbara](https://twitter.com/barbaravreede) even gave away a research data landscape themed card games to an attendee - [spreading joy](https://twitter.com/AdinaKrik/status/1231231084626575366?s=20) beyond the book dash!

Malvika kicked-off the book dash with a presentation on the project and the event ([slides](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3676448)) followed by a Q&A session addressed by Kirstie.
In the next hour,  everyone brainstormed their ideas in small groups to plan their contributions and identify their collaborators for the next day.

Our event had unintentionally overlapped with the [University and College Union (UCU) Strike](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10621/UCU-announces-14-strike-days-at-74-UK-universities-in-February-and-March) that was starting on the same day.
Even though we were not participating in the strike, we wanted to show solidarity and help the relevant tweets about the UCU strike take a central stage.
Therefore, we avoided posting tweets on _The Turing Way_, and the Book Dash event and instead encouraged our participants to tweet about the UCU strike and their goals of amplifying the much-needed discussion around working conditions, fair pay, pensions, and equality in UK universities.

We ended the day with a group dinner, which was a chance for everyone attending the book dash to connect with each other in an informal setting.

In a fun lightning talk round, attendees shared their personal stories and talked about a project that they‚Äôre either working on or are excited about.
The last speaker, Sarah Gibson, talked about her work with the Binder community, and shared about her favorite hobby of cross stitching.
She also handed out a goodie bag that she had created on behalf of _The Turing Way_ core development team for each one of us which included a cross stitch starter's kit, a cross stitch design of Binder logo, along with _The Turing Way_ stickers (designed during the last year's book dash events). üéÅüéÅ

Very thoughtfully, they also sent these as care package to our core contributors who could not join, and were dearly missed at the event!

## The book-dash working day

***See additional pictures in the photo gallery below this post.***

On 21 February, the entire book dash day was distributed into 4 long sessions.
We had organised 3 rooms for the event: first one for open discussion, second one was semi isolated for quiet working space for groups who did not need active discussions, and the third one was a quiet room for people to have breaks for decompression.
Throughout the day, everyone was encouraged to ask for help, move around or change room as needed, and offer feedback on other people's work.

The first session was kicked-off at 9:00 am by Louise Bowler who got all the attendees organised in small groups of collaborators for facilitating a discussion on their road map and plans for their chapters and other contributions.
In the second session, participants were encouraged to come up with the main sections of their chapters, which ended before the lunch break with the first set of report outs led by Sarah Gibson.
In the third and fourth session, participants worked uninterrupted on their contribution ideas in self-organised groups or individually with the support of organisers and helpers.

#### Agenda for 20th February will be as follows:

3:00 pm onward:  Arrive at the book dash venue
4:00 pm:  Intro to Turing Way and book dash
5:00 pm:  Brainstorming in groups
6:30 pm:  Arrive at the dinner venue
7:00 pm:  Dinner
8:30 pm:  Lightning talks*
9:00 - 10:30 pm:  Drinks and networking

### Lightning talks

We have allocated some time for you to give lightning talks about projects you're working on or anything else you are excited about. Those talks do not need to be related to the Turing Way or anything you want to contribute during the book dash - they can be about data visualization, your favourite R package, eccentric keyboards, meditation and wellbeing tips, beer brewing or cross-stitching. Talks should be 3 minutes long and be without the support of slides as the venue will not be able to provide any equipment to display them.

Group working and content development on 21 February
On the main book dash day, you can start working in groups (or individually if you prefer)

#### Agenda for 21st February will be as follows:

### Travel and accommodation
If you have asked for accommodation and travel support in the registration form, you will be contacted by the Turing Way team members separately with further details.

If you want to get in touch ahead of the book dash, feel free to do so on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) where you can join with your GitHub account.


## Feedback

At the end of the event Kirstie ran a "Pluses and Deltas" session to gather feedback from everyone who attended the event.
We greatly appreciate the work that our attendees have accomplished in the project during this short event and thank them for their feedback, a few of which have been highlighted below.

### Pluses

* Fantastic diverse mix of people, great conversations.
* Really well organized and professional.
* Diverse group of people - backgrounds, identities, skills.
* Great experience with collaborative working and awesome for brainstorming and developing new ideas.
* Super welcoming and inclusive atmosphere.
* Enjoyed having someone (Sam from Scriberia) there who can draw on paper what I imagine in my mind.
* Really friendly group of people with a range of different ideas.
  I liked having the options of chapter writing, reviewing and more technical stuff all in one day.
* Having lots of different options for how to contribute as a new person was really valuable.
* Nice people, and having the time to get to know people the previous day before the work started.
* Lightning talks were fun, varied and not intimidating!
* I really liked that we had folks joining remotely, I think this is a good model for folks who otherwise would not be able to make it.
* SO MANY conversations where I thought ‚Äòoh my goodness, I want your contribution to the book so I can share with my team from work‚Äô
* Empowering atmosphere.

And of course, the cross-stitch gift by Sarah was as popular as the awesome group of people at the event (she even gave a 15 minutes crash course after book-dash on cross stitching).
