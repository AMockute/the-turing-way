# Personas & Pathways in _The Turing Way_

As a community-driven and open source project, we are aware that each of our participants will have different backgrounds, different cultures, different time zones, different levels of skills and very different lived experiences.

To understand and share how our contributors or users might interact with the project, we have created this chapter of _The Turing Way_'s persona and Pathway.
Persona is a detail of an imaginary user or member, based on real-world observations and understandings of existing members or potential future members.
It is meaningful when paired with pathways through which these personas engage with a project.

*“Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much” – Helen Keller*

This chapter aims to capture different personas in _The Turing Way_ community to understand who our members are, how they come in touch with this project, how they continue to engage and how can we take their experiences and expectations into account when planning our community aspects.
