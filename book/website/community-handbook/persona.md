# Personas & Pathways in _The Turing Way_

Persona is a detail of an imaginary user or member, based on real-world observations and understandings of actual, potential or current users or members.

Persona is useful when paired with pathways, which captures how those contributors or users might interact with our project.

As a community-driven and open source project, we are aware that each of our participants will have different backgrounds, different cultures, different time zones, different levels of skills and very different lived experiences.

This chapter aims to capture different personas in _The Turing Way_ community in order to understand who our members are, how they come in touch with this project, how they continue to engage and how can we take their experiences and expectations into account when planning our community aspects.
