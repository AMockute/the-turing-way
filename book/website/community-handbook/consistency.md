# Maintaining Consistency

_The Turing Way_ project is an open-source endeavour that empowers contributors from around the world to leverage their skills, knowledge and expertise to build and expand its content.
_The Turing Way_ guides are evolving with multiple chapters co-developed by individuals from varied backgrounds, who are all passionate about sharing knowledge around data science and research.
To sustain and support this vibrant community, _The Turing Way_ book must remain consistent and accessible as it evolves. 
Although the {ref}`ch-style-guide` chapter already outlines guidelines for keeping a consistent style across the book, not all chapters follow these suggestions. 
This calls for a need to encouage and achieve retrospective consistency throughout _The Turing Way_. 
Achieving this goal is reasonably challenging. 
However, this chapter provides support by curating and introducing a consistency checklist to point contributors towards what consistency checks to look for as they help make _The Turing Way_ consistent.

## Hard vs Soft Requirements

Items in the consistency checklist are categorised into hard and soft requirements. 
Hard requirements are essential consistency checks that a chapter must pass so that _The Turing Way_ builds without errors, and is readable and accessible by everyone.

Soft requirements, on the other hand, are nice-to-have consistency checks that a chapter should pass. 
These checks greatly enhance the overall look and feel of the book but can be safely ignored.

An overview of these requirements is itemised in {ref}`below <ch-consistency-requirements-checklist>`. The rest of this chapter explains them in more detail and describes how they can be achieved.

> Please note that these requirements are not exhaustive or definitive, and neither are the classifications rigid. 
> If you identify more consistency issues that need to be addressed, join the conversation [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1174). 
> There is also no order to the items in the checklist. 
> No item is inherently more important than the other.

### Consistency Checklist

> This checklist was developed based on the insights gained from _The Turing Way's_ participation in 2020's [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) (GSoD) Programme.
> The [Technical Writer](https://github.com/paulowoicho) selected to work on _The Turing Way_ helped make the book retrospectively consistent by creating guidelines, templates, and issues to facilitate new contributions.
> The PRs and issues raised by the Technical Writer are tagged with the `gsod2020` label in _The Turing Way_ Github repo.

- Hard Requirements
  - Add labels to chapters, subchapters and images to enable cross-referencing.
  - Convert all HTML formatting to Markdown.
  - Convert image formatting from Markdown to `MyST`.
  - Remove empty files from the `_toc.yml`.
  - Ensure chapters follow a consistent structure.
  - Ensure chapters are consistent with the Turing Way Style Guide.
  - Ensure correct grammar and a consistent tone across the book.
  - Ensure chapters use a consistent language.
  - Add ALT text to images.
  - Fix Markdown formatting of non-consecutive headers
  - Remove ToCs from chapter body since one is auto-generated by `jupyter-books`.
- Soft Requirements
  - Ensure each subchapter has a good summary in their landing page.
  - Split long chapters into smaller subchapters so they are modular.
  - Ensure the names of chapters/subchapters map exactly to the left ToC.
  - Ensure proper title-casing for headers.

These checks are further categorised into the following classes: Formatting, Structure, and Language.
