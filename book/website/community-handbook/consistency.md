# Maintaining Consistency

_The Turing Way_ is an open-source project that empowers contributors around the world to leverage their skills, knowledge, and expertise to build and expand its content.
_The Turing Way_ guides are continually evolving, with multiple chapters co-developed by individuals from varied backgrounds - who are all passionate about sharing knowledge around data science and research.
To sustain and support this vibrant community, _The Turing Way_ book should remain consistent and accessible as it evolves. 
The {ref}`ch-style-guide` chapter already provides guidelines for maintaining a consistent style across the book. However, not all chapters follow these suggestions since they're often written asynchronously by different authors. 
This pointed towards a need to encourage and support our contributors to maintain consistency throughout the chapters in _The Turing Way_ guides. 
Achieving this goal alone is reasonably challenging. 
Therefore, this chapter will guide our contributors by outlining a step-by-step checklist for consistency.
Each step will point them towards what consistency checks to look for as they design and develop chapters in _The Turing Way_ or bring consistency across the existing chapters.

## Hard vs Soft Requirements

Items in the consistency checklist are categorised into hard and soft requirements. 
Hard requirements are essential consistency checks that a chapter must pass so that _The Turing Way_ builds without errors.
Moreover, they make the chapter readable and accessible to everyone.

Soft requirements, on the other hand, are nice-to-have consistency checks that a chapter should pass. 
These checks greatly enhance the overall look and feel of the book but can be safely ignored if they cannot be integrated into your contribution.
You can always return to review your past contributions and enhance their content.

An overview of these requirements is itemised {ref}`below <ch-consistency-requirements-checklist>`. The rest of this chapter explains them in more detail and describes how they can be achieved.

```{important} Please note that these requirements are not exhaustive or definitive, and neither are their classifications rigid.

If you identify more consistency issues that need to be addressed, join the conversation [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1174).

No item is inherently more important than the other.

### Consistency Checklist

#### Hard Requirements

##### Formatting

- Use Markdown for creating your content (see this [cheatsheet from WordPress](https://wordpress.com/support/markdown-quick-reference/))
  - Avoid any HTML formatting, or remove all HTML tags when reviewing existing chapters
- Use the headers in sequential order (for example, starting the top level with h1 tag `#`, second-level header with h2 tag `##` and so on)
- Add labels to chapters, subchapters and images to enable cross-referencing as described in the {ref}`style guide<ch-style-crossref>`
- Use `MyST` for image formatting as described in the {ref}`style guide<ch-style-figures>`
  - Use public domain images that are less than 1MB in size and cite appropriately
  - Add a descriptive ALT text to images to allow screen reading software to describe images well to its users

##### Structure

  - Ensure chapters follow a structure as described in this [chapter template](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/templates/CHAPTER_TEMPLATE.md)
  
  - Do not add a 'table of content' in chapters or subchapters as it is auto-generated by the Jupyter Book
  - Ensure external sources are properly referenced and included in the centralised bibtex file as recommended in the {ref}`style guide<ch-style-citing>`
  - Do not add any empty files in the `_toc.yml`, instead create an issue for new chapters

##### Language

TYPE | REQUIREMENT | CHECK 
---- | ----------- | ----- 
Language | Hard | Ensure chapters do not use any Latin abbreviation as discussed in the {ref}`style guide<ch-style-guide>`
Language | Hard | Ensure correct grammar and a consistent tone across the book with the help of 1-2 reviewers
Language | Hard | Ensure chapters use a consistent language, for example, if you choose to write in British English, maintain that throughout



- Ensure that the names of chapters/subchapters are short and map exactly to how they are titled in the `_toc.yml`
- Ensure proper title-casing for headers
  - Capitalise the first, last and 'important' words of every title; for example, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'.

##### Structure

  - Ensure each chapter has a good summary on its landing page along with links to its subchapters.
  - Split long chapters into smaller subchapters so they are modular
  

These checks are further explained in the following subchapters: {ref}`Formatting<ch-consistency-formatting>`, {ref}`Structure<ch-consistency-structure>`, and {ref}`Language<ch-consistency-language>`.

Please note that the classification of our consistency checklist into these subchapters is only to make it easy for us to describe them in the context of format, structure, and language.
They may not follow the exact order as listed in the checklist on this page.
