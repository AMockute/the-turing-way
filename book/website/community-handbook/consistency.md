# Achieving Retrospective Consistency

_The Turing Way_ project is an open-source endeavour that empowers contributors from around the world to leverage their skills, knowledge and expertise to build and expand its content.
With over 200 contributors, _The Turing Way_ was created (and is evolving!) based on the efforts of individuals from varied backgrounds who are all passionate about open science.
To sustain and support this vibrant community, _The Turing Way_ must remain consistent and accessible. 
Although the {ref}`ch-style-guide` chapter already outlines guidelines for keeping a consistent style across the book, not all chapters follow these suggestions. 
This calls for a need to encouage and achieve retrospective consistency throughout _The Turing Way_. 
Achieving this goal is reasonably challenging. 
However, this chapter provides support by curating and introducing a consistency checklist to point contributors towards what consistency checks to look for as they help make _The Turing Way_ retrospectively consistent.

## Hard vs Soft Requirements

Items in the consistency checklist are categorised into hard and soft requirements. 
Hard requirements are essential consistency checks that a chapter must pass so that _The Turing Way_ builds without errors, and can be read easily by everyone - regardless of device.

Soft requirements, on the other hand, are nice-to-have consistency checks that a chapter should pass. 
These checks greatly enhance the overall look and feel of the book but can be safely ignored.

An overview of these requirements is itemised below. The rest of this chapter will explain them in more detail and describe how they can be achieved.

> Please note that these requirements are not exhaustive. If you identify more consistency issues that need to be addressed, join the conversation [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1174).

- Hard Requirements
  - Enable cross-referencing by adding labels to chapters, subchapters and images.
  - Convert all HTML formatting to markdown.
  - Convert image formatting from markdown to `MyST`.
  - Remove empty files from the `_toc.yml`.
  - Ensure chapters follow a consistent structure.
  - Ensure chapters are consistent with the Turing Way Style Guide.
  - Ensure correct grammar and a consistent tone across the book.
  - Ensure chapters use a consistent language. 
- Soft Requirements
  - Remove ToCs from chapter body since one is auto-generated by `jupyter-books`.
  - Ensure each subchapter has a good summary in their landing page.
  - Split long chapters to smaller chapters, so they are modular.
  - Ensure the names of chapters/subchapters map exactly to the left ToC.
  - Ensure proper title-casing for headers
