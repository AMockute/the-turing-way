# Maintaining Consistency

_The Turing Way_ project is an open-source endeavour that empowers contributors from around the world to leverage their skills, knowledge and expertise to build and expand its content.
_The Turing Way_ guides are evolving with multiple chapters co-developed by individuals from varied backgrounds, who are all passionate about sharing knowledge around data science and research.
To sustain and support this vibrant community, _The Turing Way_ book must remain consistent and accessible as it evolves. 
Although the {ref}`ch-style-guide` chapter already outlines guidelines for keeping a consistent style across the book, not all chapters follow these suggestions as they have been written asynchronously by different authors. 
This calls for a need to encourage and support our contributors to maintain consistency throughout the chapters in _The Turing Way_ guides. 
Achieving this goal alone is reasonably challenging. 
Therefore, this chapter will guide our contributors by outlining a step-by-step checklist for consistency.
Each step will point them towards what consistency checks to look for as they design and develop chapters in _The Turing Way_ or bring consistency across the existing chapters.

## Hard vs Soft Requirements

Items in the consistency checklist are categorised into hard and soft requirements. 
Hard requirements are essential consistency checks that a chapter must pass so that _The Turing Way_ builds without errors, and is readable and accessible by everyone.

Soft requirements, on the other hand, are nice-to-have consistency checks that a chapter should pass. 
These checks greatly enhance the overall look and feel of the book but can be safely ignored if you can't manage to integrate them into your contribution.
You can always return to review your past contributions and enhance their content.

An overview of these requirements is itemised in {ref}`below <ch-consistency-requirements-checklist>`. The rest of this chapter explains them in more detail and describes how they can be achieved.

> Please note that these requirements are not exhaustive or definitive, and neither are the classifications rigid. 
> If you identify more consistency issues that need to be addressed, join the conversation [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/1174). 
> There is also no order to the items in the checklist. 
> No item is inherently more important than the other.

### Consistency Checklist

> This checklist was developed based on the insights gained from _The Turing Way's_ participation in 2020's [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) (GSoD) Programme.
> The [Technical Writer](https://github.com/paulowoicho) selected to work on _The Turing Way_ helped make the book retrospectively consistent by creating guidelines, templates, and issues to facilitate new contributions.
> The PRs and issues raised by the Technical Writer are tagged with the `gsod2020` label in _The Turing Way_ Github repo.

- Hard Requirements
  - Add labels to chapters, subchapters and images to enable cross-referencing.
  - Convert all HTML formatting to Markdown.
  - Convert image formatting from Markdown to `MyST`.
  - Remove empty files from the `_toc.yml`.
  - Ensure chapters follow a consistent structure.
  - Ensure chapters are consistent with the Turing Way Style Guide.
  - Ensure correct grammar and a consistent tone across the book.
  - Ensure chapters use a consistent language.
  - Add ALT text to images.
  - Fix Markdown formatting of non-consecutive headers
  - Remove ToCs from chapter body since one is auto-generated by `jupyter-books`.
- Soft Requirements
  - Ensure each subchapter has a good summary in their landing page.
  - Split long chapters into smaller subchapters so they are modular.
  - Ensure the names of chapters/subchapters map exactly to the left ToC.
  - Ensure proper title-casing for headers.

These checks are further categorised into the following classes: Formatting, Structure, and Language.
