Language is concerned with the style with which _The Turing Way_ is written.
A consistent language ensures that _The Turing Way_ is clear and understandable.

The checks that deal with _The Turing Way's_ language include:

### Check 1: Ensure correct grammar and a consistent tone across the book

For readers of all backgrounds, knowledge, and skill level to understand _The Turing Way_, correct grammar and a consistent tone is necessary.

Asides from being distracting, incorrect grammar may take away from the message a piece of text tries to communicate.

Tools such as [Grammarly](www.grammarly.com), [Ginger Grammar](https://www.gingersoftware.com/grammarcheck), and [Reverso Speller](https://www.reverso.net/spell-checker/english-spelling-grammar/) help to catch any grammatical errors present in a piece of text. 
These tools can be used to grammatically assess the content of _The Turing Way_ chapters.

With regards tone, ensure that chapters adhere to a formal level of writing and that sentences are easy to digest.
One rule of thumb to think about is, if a sentence needs to be read more than once to be understood, then it needs to be rephrased.

### Check 2: Ensure chapters use a consistent language

> Language, in this context, refers to the American and British variants of the English language.

With contributors from around the world, _The Turing Way_ does not restrict the language used to write chapters.
This makes it easier for contributors to bring in their perspectives as they write content for _The Turing Way_.
Rather, the recommendation is that if a chapter is written in one style (for example, British English), then it should stay consistent throughout. 
This makes _The Turing Way_ less distracting and easier to read.
