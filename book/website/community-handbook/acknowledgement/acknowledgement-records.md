# Records of contributions

Two documents are considered a record of contributions.

## 1. Contributors Table

The [Contributors](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way#contributors) section in [README](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/README.md) file is updated with every contributor's name using [all contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/) with their [emoji keys](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).

This emoji key is used for recording and fairly acknowledging the different types of contributions our community members have made.
No contribution is too small.
These contributions can be (but not limited to) bug fixing, chapter planning, writing, editing, reviewing, idea generation, presentation, project management, and maintenance.
Please see the subchapter {ref}`ch-persona-contributions` for details.

## 2. Contributors file

The details for each contributor will be listed in the contributor's file called [`contributors.md`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/contributors.md) file with the following details, which will be referred as `contributor's detail` in the rest of this document:

> * Name: `Contributor's name`
> * GitHub id: `GitHub id`
> * ORCID: `ORCID id of the contributor`
> * List of contributions on GitHub: `A list of PRs, issues and comments`

Below, we will discuss how to record different contributions by adding details and pathways of contribution to the following text field:
> * Pathways of contributions: `details discussed below`

Additionally, contributors can opt to add more information they think can help them highlight their engagement with _The Turing Way_ project by supplementing information to the following text field:
> * More information: `personal information provided by the contributors`

*Text fields should be provided with details for each contributor with specific information by replacing the text describing the requested information inside the backticks "``"*

### Recording different types of contributions

Specifications for all types of contributions can be added in the [contributors file](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/contributors.md) after adding the `contributor's detail` for each contributor.
We have listed examples for some of the most common contribution types, which you can use as a guide.
As a contributor, you will be able to add as many details as useful for your record.

#### Bug fixes

We use the term "bug" for small errors in the text or code like typos formatting issues or broken links.

Anyone who raises bugs, related issues or fixes them are listed as contributors in the Contributors table with  :bug: emoji (`bug`).

The contributor's file will be updated for the contributors with a similar statement as below after the `contributor's detail`:
> * Pathways of contributions: `Contributor's Name` has fixed typos and made other contributions `other details like identified sections of the book that are unclear`.

### Reviewing chapters and other pull requests

The review process of a newly contributed chapter or a subsection of an existing chapter involves approving the language and structure of a chapter or a section of a chapter, flagging errors or typos, asking for clarifications if certain parts of the content or statements are unclear, suggesting modifications and improving the overall quality of someone's contribution.

Anyone who reviews a chapter is listed as reviewers and are acknowledged with :eyes: emoji (`review`) in the Contributors table.

The contributor's file will be updated for the contributors with a similar statement as below:
> * Pathways of contributions: `Contributor's name` reviewed the chapter `Chapter name`. They made other contributions to the chapter `other details like structuring and adding references`.

### Chapter contribution

The various contributions to a chapter are made towards designing, writing, and reviewing its content through GitHub issues, pull requests, and reviewing processes.

The designing, writing, and reviewing of a chapter's content are acknowledged with :thinking_face: emoji (`idea`), :lower_left_fountain_pen: emoji (`content`) and :eyes: emoji (`review`) respectively in the Contributors table.

All these personas will be named as an author on the last release of the book.
The contributor's file will be updated for the contributors with a similar statement as below:
> * Pathways of contributions: `Contributor's name` designed and wrote a chapter on <chapter name> and `details on reviewing and structuring new content`.

### Translation

The translation process in _The Turing Way_ includes aspects translating _The Turing Way_ chapters into languages other than English and reviewing them.
The translation infrastructure as of May 2020 is [Trasifex](https://www.transifex.com/theturingway/theturingway/dashboard/).

Contributors will be acknowledged in the Contributors table with the :earth_africa: emoji (`translation`).

The contributor's file will be updated for the contributors with a similar statement as below:
> * Pathways of contributions: `Contributor's name` has translated part of the chapter `chapter name` into `language`. They have also `details like designed and implemented a process to translate the book into multiple languages, mentored multiple contributors within the community and has translated 3 chapters of The Turing Way into Chinese`.

### Organisational support

When members participate in _The Turing Way_ community with the in-kind support of their funders and organisation, we acknowledge each member individually and list their organisations as "Collaborating organisations".
Such organisational supports are applicable when one or multiple members from a project or community collaborate to build resources in _The Turing Way_.
These efforts are highly encouraged to ensure the sustainability of their resources that can benefit a much wider community.

Each organisation who supports its members to collaborate with _The Turing Way_ will be listed as "Collaborating organisations" in the contributor's file.
Each contributor from these organisation will be acknowledged individually in the Contributors Table for their specific contributions with emoji keys reflecting specific contributions made with the organisational support.
Their contributors will be listed under their organisation's name in the contributor's file.

Every contribution will be updated with a similar statement as below:
> * Pathways of contributions: `Contributor's name` have also made contributions `contribution type` to the chapters `chapter name`. They have also `details on other contributions like managing a team of contributors, writing a chapter`.

### Maintenance

Maintenance work in _The Turing Way_ applies to the conversations in community spaces, technical infrastructure, online hosting platforms for the book, and translation infrastructure of Transifex.

Contributors will be acknowledged in the Contributors table with the :speech_balloon:
emoji (`question`) for answering questions, :thinking_face: emoji (`ideas`) for discussions, ðŸš‡ emoji (`infra`) for infrastructure support, and ðŸš§ (`maintenance`) for community efforts or infrastructure maintenance.

The contributor's file will be updated for the contributors with a similar statement as below:
> * Pathways of contributions: `Contributor's name` has `details like responded to questions in the community's Gitter channel, mentored multiple contributors within the community and has reviewed pull requests to fix typos in the book, maintains the backend infrastructure of the project, provide support and solution regarding Jupyter book and continuous integration, designed and implemented a process to translate the book into multiple languages, helped multiple contributors in facilitating translation efforts`.  

### Representing the Turing Way

Anyone who shares _The Turing Way_ resources in any relevant publication, learning material, conference presentations, or community event are acknowledged for representing _The Turing Way_.
These members may or may not have previously contributed to the project.
They either volunteer or are recommended by _The Turing Way_ team members for representing this community within or outside the project.

Each contributor who represents _The Turing Way_ at an event is acknowledged in the Contributors table with the :loudspeaker: emoji (`Talk`) in the Contributors Table along with other contributions as applicable.

Their contributions will be listed in the contributor's file with a similar statement as below:
> * Pathways of contributions: `Contributor's name` has presented a talk at _The Turing Way_ at `event's name`. They have also `details like mentored multiple contributors within the community and have given talks at <event's name> on behalf of the community.
