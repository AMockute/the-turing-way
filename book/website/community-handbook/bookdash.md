# _The Turing Way_ Book Dash Events

Th bookdash events are a shorter version of [Book Sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_sprint), where participants work on _The Turing Way_ book synchronously on the same day either in person or online.
As a community-driven guidebook, _The Turing Way_ welcomes researchers from diverse fields and backgrounds at these events for contributing new chapters and reviewing existing contents to make them accessible and comprehensive for a wider community.

_The Turing Way_ Book Dash is one and half day-long event where participants collaboratively develop and enhance resources in the Turing Way book.
The  Turing Way can benefit from.
The skills and contributions that we're looking for include, but are not limited to:

- science communication skills: skills in writing, editing and/or exciting interactive communications
- great examples and case studies of reproducible research
- writing new chapters
- editing the current chapters
- updating how the book looks online (css, logos, layout etc).

## Getting prepared for the book dash

We will ask you to contribute to the [Turing Way GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way). Please sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join. If you're not familiar with contributing to GitHub projects, we recommend you read our chapter on Collaborating on GitHub. Our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are also a good thing to read, but we will go through the main points again on the book dash day. We hope you already have an idea of what you would like to contribute, but if you are still looking for inspiration, our list of [good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) will hopefully provide some inspiration.

### Online drop-in session on 12th February
We will hold two calls on the 12th of February (1-hour each) for you to drop-in and get your questions and concerns related to the Turing Way project, GitHub skills, or book dash logistics addressed by the Turing Way team members. The first call will take place at 8:00 am GMT and the second call will take place at 16:00 pm GMT. You can sign up on this HackMD to mark your attendance.

## Getting to the venue

On 20th February, you can arrive at the venue using the general entrance to the British Library, [here are instructions on how to get to The Alan Turing Institute](https://whitakerlab.github.io/visit). The institute is located on the first floor. You will be asked to sign in at The Alan Turing Instituteâ€™s reception, after which you can join the Turing Way team and the other participants at the social area.

On 21st February, we will start the book dash before the British Library officially opens at 9:30 am so you will need to enter through Gate 8 of The British Library, the staff entrance on Midland Road opposite (one of the exits from) St Pancras station . Give your name at the security desk to receive your visitor pass for the day. A Turing Way team member will be waiting in the lobby and escort you to the Turing Institute.

Introduction and networking on 20 February (optional)
We're looking forward to welcoming you on 20 February for a short introduction session at The Alan Turing Institute, followed by a dinner. Participation is optional but highly encouraged. We will briefly introduce the book dash events and facilitate discussion to allow you to sketch out your plan for the next day.
