# Weekly Coworking Calls

_The Turing Way_ team has been hosting shorter coworking calls each week. 
These calls are similar to the Collaboration Cafes, but only 1-hour long.
Since May 2020, these calls have been taking place multiple days each week at 11:00 GMT/BST.
It is not hosted on the days when there is a Collaboration Cafe already scheduled.

Like Collaboration Cafes, we host these calls online using [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/).
We use the Shut up & Write! method by providing allocated time for two 20-25 minutes long Pomodoro sessions and two short breaks to chat about our work and exchange what we got done.

The primary target of these calls are members who are working on certain issues or PRs in _The Turing Way_ to come along and join other community members in their usual working hours.
These calls also provide opportunities to clarify doubts about the project, get PRs reviewed, brainstorm different ideas together, and stay connected with other members in the community.

## Attending an online coworking call

The schedule for these coworking calls is updated weekly [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=theturingway%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).
We announce these in our [monthly newsletters](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/archive) and send a reminder every Monday on the [Slack channel](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack).

Though scheduled for 1 hour, you are welcome to join for shorter period as your schedule allows, however, please let the host of the call know so that they know who to expect on the call.
If you are interested in coworking with one of the team members on a day that is not listed on the schedule, please contact them on Slack or by email so that they can find a common slot to work with you. 

### Resource used for the call

The resource requirement for these calls is also very similar to the Collaboration Cafe.

1. Shared notes by [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/): [https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking](https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking)
2. Online call by [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/): The Zoom link is provided in the HackMD.
3. An online Pomodoro clock: [https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking)

We don't record these calls.
We also don't create {ref}`breakout rooms<ch-coworking-collabcafe-breakout>` unless there are multiple people working on same things.

### Format of the call

We have a template for the {ref}`Collaboration Cafes<ch-coworking-weekly-template>`, which is updated on the [shared HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking) for each week.

We'll run the following schedule during each call:

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start | 👋 Welcome |
| 5 mins | Introductions and personal goal setting |
| 25 mins | 🍅 1st Pomodoro session |
| 5 mins | ☕️ Break and report out |
| 25 mins | 🍅 2nd Pomodoro session |
| 5 mins | Open discussion and Close 👋 |

In contrast to the Collaboration Cafes, the schedule for these calls seems more intense with less chance for discussion.
However, since these calls are attended by fewer participants, it provides more opportunities for informal interactions.

#### Beginning

The call begins with the team members welcoming the participants, sharing the Code of Conduct, reminding how to participate in the call, and setting the stage for everyone to share how they are doing and what they will be working on.

#### Pomodoros

We will start the [timer](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking) to keep track of the Pomodoro sessions.
If everyone plans to work on independent tasks, we will remain in the main room and work silently.
For any discussion or collaborative task that two people of the call are working on, we will create [breakout rooms](#breakout-rooms) for them.

If there are new members on the call, one of the members (usually host of the call) will take the new member to a breakout room to show around the project repository and share some tips for getting started.

#### Breaks

We will take short breaks after each Pomodoro to reflect on what we could get done, troubleshoot any error that any attendee might have come across, verbalise our progress and celebrate small successes.

#### If joining this call later

If you join later, you might see people quietly working on their tasks.
You can track the time left before the next break by opening the [shared clock](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking) in your browser.
If you know in advance that you'd join later, you can let the host of the call know by either contacting them before the call or leaving a note in the shared document.

#### Coworking with your colleagues

If you would like to set up similar coworking calls for your community, you can reuse the format, template, and materials described in this chapter.

Practices described here are what we use in _The Turing Way_, but there are more ways to run such coworking calls. 
For example, Naomi Penfold shared about her coworking format while reviewing this chapter:

> In the co-working calls I have, it's 1:1 and we often spend 20 minutes at the beginning catching up and taking about our progress since last time.
If there is something we want to discuss more intensely, we allocate 30 minutes of our call time to that, for example, one of us asking the other how to troubleshoot something. 
For the time in between, we do a few quiet working sessions (sometimes 25 minutes, sometimes longer).
This is likely a combination of a co-mentoring call and a co-working pomodoro call, and it works well for me.
