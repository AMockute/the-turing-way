# Daily Coworking Calls

_The Turing Way_ team has been hosting coworking calls almost every day at 11:00 GMT/BST.
These calls are similar to the Collaboration Cafes, but only 1-hour long.
It is not scheduled on the days when there is a Collaboration Cafe already scheduled, the daily coworking call.

Like Collaboration Cafe, we host these calls online using [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/).
We use the Shut up & Write! method by providing allocated time for two 20-25 minutes long Pomodoro sessions and two short breaks to chat about our work and exchange what we got done.

These calls are hosted for people who are working on certain issues or PRs in _The Turing Way_ to come along and join other community members in their usual working hours.
These calls also provide opportunities to clarify doubts about the project, get PRs reviewed, brainstorm different ideas together, and stay connected with other members in the community.

## Attending an online coworking call

The schedule for the daily coworking calls is updated weekly [community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=theturingway%40gmail.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon) for every month.
We announce these in our [monthly newsletters](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay/archive) and send a reminder every Monday on the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way).

Though scheduled for 1 hour, you are welcome to join for as long as your schedule allows, however, please let the host of the call know if you plan to join in the middle of the schedule.

### Resource used for the call

The resource requirement for these calls is also very similar to the Collaboration Cafe.

1. Shared notes by [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/): [https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking](https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking)
2. Online call by [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/): The Zoom link is provided in the HackMD.
3. An online Pomodoro clock: [https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking)

We don't record the call or create [breakout rooms](#breakout-rooms) during these call (unless there are multiple people working on same things).

### Format of the call

We have a template for the {ref}`Collaboration Cafes<ch-coworking-daily-template>`, which is updated on the [shared HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@malvikasharan/TW-coworking) for each week.

We'll run the following schedule during each call:

| Duration | Activity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Start | üëã Welcome |
| 5 mins | Introductions and personal goal setting |
| 25 mins | üçÖ 1st Pomodoro session |
| 5 mins | ‚òïÔ∏è Break and report out |
| 25 mins | üçÖ 2nd Pomodoro session |
| 5 mins | Open discussion and Close üëã |

The call begins with the team members welcoming the participants, sharing the Code of Conduct, reminding how to participate in the call, and setting the stage for everyone to share what they will be working on.

If there is no new member, we will directly start the [timer](https://cuckoo.team/TW-coworking) for the first Pomodoro.
If everyone is working on an independent task, we will remain in the main room and work silently.
For any discussion or collaborative task that two people of the call are working on, we will create [breakout rooms](#breakout-rooms) for them.

We will take short breaks after each Pomodoro to reflect on what we could get done and what would be the next step.

In contrast to the Collaboration Cafes, the schedule for these daily calls seems more intense with less chance for discussion.
However, since these calls are attended by fewer participants, it provides more opportunities for informal interactions.

If you would like to set up similar coworking calls for your community, you can reuse the format, template, and materials described in this chapter.
