# Organising coworking call for your community

If you would like to set up coworking calls for your community, you can repurpose and adapt the format, templates, and materials discussed in this chapter to support your teams and communities.

Practices described here are what we use in _The Turing Way_, but there are more ways to run such coworking calls.
Below, I describe different aspects that you should take into consideration when planning or designing your coworking calls.

## Choose the format the works for you

Here are a few organisation and logistics related questions that you should address for yourself for identifying what will be the best format for your coworking calls:

**Purpose of your coworking calls**

In _The Turing Way_, as described in the {ref}`motivation <ch-coworking-motivation>` subchapter, we host these calls for building connections, supporting our contributors, onboarding new members and celebrating their work.

Your purpose for hosting coworking calls could be completely different and identifying that is important for you to plan the remaining logistics.
A few other scenarios could be:
  - If you work from home, you would like to see your colleagues and stay connected with them through designated coworking schedules.
  - If you are working with a distributed group of people on a common project, and if communication and exchange related to the project while working asynchronously is an issue, you can get a lot of your work done over a coworking call.
  - If you are working on multiple projects and struggle to focus on one task at a time, coworking can help you put aside a few hours of your time to work with your colleagues who you share the project with.
  - If there is a task you are struggling to complete, you can invite support from you trusted colleagues through coworking calls.

**Organisers and hosts**

These tasks can be taken care of by one person like a community manager, project manager, or a volunteer organiser.
However, it is always a good idea to involve more people as co-organisers so that the coworking call still happens event when the main organiser can't join for any reason.
To avoid one person to burden themselves with "not so exciting" organisation issues, you can also decide to rotate the role within the members of your project.

**Target audience**

If you already know the purpose of your coworking calls, you will be able to identify who your target audience is.

For example, if you host your coworking calls for an open source project such as _The Turing Way_, you can expect your current members, past contributors or even new members to the project to participate.
If you are part of a small project, you would expect the same familiar faces in all your coworking calls.

**Logistics and tasks**

Like any event, coworking calls will also need someone to take responsibility of organising, hosting and making sure that they happen.
Many tasks go into organising a coworking call.
As organisers or the event you will be required to:
- choose the right tools:
  - hosting the calls: few options are Zoom, Google Hangout, Skype, Jisti
  - managing registration: few options are via shared notes, Zoom, Eventbrite, Google form
  - facilitating chats: few oprions are Slack, Gitter, phone appearances
  - maintaining shared notes: few options are Etherpad, HackMD, GitHub, Google doc
  - sharing timers: few options are cuckoo.team or other web based timers
  - finding a common availability: few options are Doodle, when2meet.com, Calendly, shared calendar system
- schedule the calls on the agreed dates and time, or periodically in a week or month by involving people who would like to participate in coworking calls.
- update the schedule, agenda and calendar to share them with the attendees (or potential target audience). It is particularly crucial to use a meeting links like [arewemeetingyet](arewemeetingyet.com/), when hosting these calls for members from different countries so that they can see the time in their time zones. It is also quite effective when they receive a calendar invite.
- maintain communication (by email, newsletter, or social media) so that everyone is aware of the next calls and the resources available for them to participate.
- provide adequate support to the participants during the call so that they can make the best of their time. In our coworking calls, we find it useful to use breakout room if some people need more discussions, while others can quietly work on their tasks.
- communicate the notes with participants after the call and share any useful resources or ideas they discussed during the coworking call.
- most importantly, create a safe and accountable space:
  - It is important to design these calls to ensure that everyone feels welcome, involved and safe. It's highly recommended to choose a Code of Conduct, share that with everyone in advanced and put a reporting guideline in place. See this minimal [CoC from Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and an expanded version of {ref}`_The Turing Way_ CoC<ch-coc>`.
  - It is equally important to create an agenda that helps people understand what is expected of them, such as if they should bring their tasks and questions in the call or communicate it beforehand. In _The Turing Way_, we have dedicated slots for both group discussions and quiet working.
  - You should also communicate the basic etiquettes, such as muting microphones when not speaking or not interrupt others when working in a Pomodoro session unless neccessary.
  - It's useful to let everyone know who they can contact if they need help in troubleshooting during the call or need more time to discuss their ideas.

**Size of the call**

No matter who your target audience is and what the purpose of your call is, you can decide the size of your call by managing participation by prior registration.
If you organise these calls for your project members on a mutually agreed time and with an agenda to work on specific tasks, you can expect most of them to show up.

If you keep your call open for any of your community members join, you may end up having a different number of participants on different calls.
This would also mean that for some calls, there won't be anyone available to co-work with you.

It's useful to handle some sort of sign-up sheet or registration system to organisers know who to expect on the call.
In _The Turing Way_, we use dedicated HackMDs that are updated before each call.

**Frequency of these calls**

Once you identify the purpose, your target audience and the size of your call, you can decide how often you would like to host your calls.
If you work with the same group of people, you can host it as per your common availability and a mutually agreed time on a weekly or monthly basis.

If you host it for a group of people who work on multiple projects, you might consider hosting it on the same day and time each week or each month.
This will allow them to check their availability in advance and block these hours in their calendar.
This will also reduce the extra work of coordinating schedules every time (though you will have to do this in the beginning).

**Resource availability**

Based on the resources available to you, you might have to fine-tune other aspects of your call.
For example:
- Shared calendar: If there is a calendar that are updated with the coworking calls schedule, people can subscribe to them and indicate their availability.
- Communication platforms: software like Zoom can allow you to connect with many people at the same time. However, you will need a paid subscription (pro account) to control who joins your call (by activating waiting room to avoid Zoom bombing), manage breakout rooms (to allow multiple small groups and discussions) or host longer calls (>40 minutes).
- Chat system: If you have a group Slack or Gitter channel, information can be exchanged everyone, including those who can not join the calls but can offer suggestions or carry related tasks asynchronously but in coordination with the group.
This also allows people to keep each other informed of any last-minute changes such as new call joining link, correct notes, or cancellation of calls.

## Some Examples

### Open calls for building connections

One of _The Turing Way_ contributors, Natalie Thurlby has adapted the Collaboration CafÃ© to create a [Data science online co-working group](http://bristol.ac.uk/golding/ask-jgi/data-science-online-co-working-group/).
They have designed their call format for the Jean Golding Institute community members in Bristol to work together and build connections while working on their data science projects.
This is a great example of using coworking calls for community building and supporting others with similar research interests.

### Small groups for supporting each other

You can also plan your coworking calls with a small group of (2-3) colleagues with whom you can mutually hold accountability for your time and work.
A small group reduces the burden of coordinating multiple time zones and finding a schedule that is suitable for everyone.
Naomi Penfold and Stefanie Butland have written about their 1:1 coworking format in this post: [Online Co-working Partnerships are Community of Practice in Action](https://www.cscce.org/2020/02/04/online-co-working-partnerships-are-community-of-practice-in-action/#more-3009).
While reviewing this chapter, Naomi described their 1:1 call format in contrast with _The Turing Way_ group format as follows:

> In the co-working calls I have, it's 1:1 and we often spend 20 minutes in the beginning catching up and talking about our progress since last time.
If there is something we want to discuss more intensely, we allocate 30 minutes of our call time to that, for example, one of us asking the other how to troubleshoot something.
For the time in between, we do a few quiet working sessions (sometimes 25 minutes, sometimes longer).
This is likely a combination of a co-mentoring call and a co-working Pomodoro call, and it works well for me.

You can read an adapted version of their blog post along with other ideas for virtual events in the {ref}`guidebook by Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement <CSCCE2020virtual>`
