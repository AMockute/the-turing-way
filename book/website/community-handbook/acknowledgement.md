# Acknowledging Contributors

_The Turing Way_ is collaboratively developed by its diverse community of researchers, learners, educators, and other stakeholders.
This project can simply not exist without the collaborative nature of this project and the willingness of our community members to work cooperatively in this book.
We value all kinds of contributions in this project and are committed to recognising each of them fairly.

Everyone has a skill that is useful for someone, and therefore anyone can contribute to _The Turing Way_.

In the previous subchapter on {ref}`Contribution types and pathways <ch-persona-contributions>`, we have provided an overview of different kinds of contributions that are possible in this project with the help of personas and pathways.
We also described how we acknowledge them in the contributor's table in the [README file](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/README.md#contributors).

In this chapter, we provide details on the following aspects:
- who our contributors and community members are
- how we create opportunities for a shared ownership of this project
- how we can use records of contributions to highlight work of our community members
- what the different types and possible pathways for contributions exist in _The Turing Way_
