# Overview of Project Design

## Summary

Project design techniques can help researchers clearly communicate their project plan, requirements, available resources and everything else that ensures that they can efficiently work together at all stages of research, apply research principles for reproducibility and communicate their work effectively.
A project design requires managers and organisers to be deliberate and clear about their plans from the beginning of their projects to ensure successful implementation of their plan at all stages of research.

In this chapter, we have curated good practices to ensure that we maintain good communication (and avoid miscommunication), create opportunities for collaboration and ultimately ensure reproducibility at different stages of the project.

## Background & Motivation

Everyone applies various design concepts to their project formally or informally.
However, often we think about these concepts retrospectively, when the project is over and we gain a better understanding of design mistakes that could have been avoided with better planning and organisation.

This lack of planning contributes to the fact that most research work can not be directly and independently reproduced, and that communication and collaboration style across different groups differ and hence are challenging.

To help learn good practices, *The Turing Way* provides various chapters for {ref}`reproducibility<rr>`, {ref}`communication<cm>` and {ref}`collaboration<cl>` that we consider essential for research reproducibility.
Although publications{cite}`Turkyilmaz-vanderVelden2020projectdesign` and _The Turing Way_ chapters on specific methods, tools and practices exist it can be overwhelming to know which chapters to read if you don't already know about the concepts.

In this chapter, we have curated essential practices and recommendations and linked them to individual chapters across different guides.

```{note}
There are many chapters that we don't link here to avoid cognition load for readers who are new to reproducible project design.
We invite you to contribute to this chapter to add important tools or practices that have not been mentioned here.

In the different subchapters we discuss how you can {ref}`start planning<pd-overview-planning>` for project design, the {ref}` communication and collaboration<pd-overview-repro>` aspect for ensuring reproducibilty, {ref}`tools and methods<pd-overview-methods>` for reproducibility, {ref}`version control and documentation<pd-overview-version>` aspects and {ref}`sharing your research<pd-overview-sharing>`.
