## Summary

Open Science aims to transform science by making research more reproducible, transparent, re-usable, collaborative, accountable and closer to society. It is about the way research is carried out, disseminated, deployed and transformed by digital tools.  The OECD defines Open Science as:  “to make the primary outputs of publicly funded research results – publications and the research data – publicly accessible in digital format with no or minimal restriction”, but it is more than that. Open Science is frequently defined as an umbrella term that involves various movements aiming to remove the barriers for sharing any kind of output, resources, methods or tools, at any stage of the research process.

Features of Open Science
- Open Notebooks - an emerging practice, documenting and sharing the experimental process of trial and error;
- Open Data - managing research data in a way that optimises access, discoverability and sharing for use and re-use;
- Open Research Software - documenting research code and routines, and making them freely accessible and available for collaboration;
- Open Access - making all published outputs freely accessible for maximum use and impact.

In order to achieve this openness in science, each element of the research process should:
- Be publicly available: it is difficult to use and benefit from knowledge hidden behind barriers such as passwords;
- Be re-usable: research outputs need to be licensed appropriately so that prospective users know clearly any limitations on re-use;
- Be transparent and have appropriate metadata to provide clear statements of how research output was produced, and can be re-used.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful

There are five main schools of thought motivating open practises to benefit scientific research:

| School                     | Belief               | Aim                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure | Efficient research depends on the available tools and applications. | Creating openly available platforms, tools and services for scientists. |
| Pragmatic | Knowledge-creation could be more efficient if scientists worked together. | Opening up the process of knowledge creation. |
| Measurement | Scientific contributions today need alternative impact measurements. | Developing an alternative metric system for scientific impact. |
| Democratic | The access to knowledge is unequally distributed. | Making knowledge freely available for everyone. |
| Public | Science needs to be made accessible to the public. | Making science accessible for citizens. |

Open practises also benefits the researchers that propagate them. For example there is evidence that open access articles are cited more, as shown by the metastudy presented in the figure [below](open_access_figure).

<a name="open_access_figure"></a>
| ![open_acess_citatations](open_acess_citatations.jpg) |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |
| The relative citation rate (OA: non-OA) in 19 fields of research. This rate is defined as the mean citation rate of OA articles divided by the mean citation rate of non-OA articles. Multiple points for the same discipline indicate different estimates from the same study, or estimates from several studies. References by discipline: Agricultural studies (Kousha and Abdoli, 2010); Physics/astronomy (Gentil-Beccot et al., 2010; Harnad and Brody, 2004; Metcalfe, 2006); Medicine (Sahu et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2011); Computer science (Lawrence, 2001); Sociology/social sciences (Hajjem et al., 2006; Norris et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2011); Psychology (Hajjem et al., 2006); Political science (Hajjem et al., 2006; Antelman, 2004; Atchison and Bull, 2015); Management (Hajjem et al., 2006); Law (Donovan et al., 2015; Hajjem et al., 2006); Economics (Hajjem et al., 2006; McCabe and Snyder, 2015; Norris et al., 2008; Wohlrabe, 2014); Mathematics (Antelman, 2004; Davis and Fromerth, 2007; Norris et al., 2008); Health (Hajjem et al., 2006); Engineering (Antelman, 2004; Koler-Povh et al., 2014); Philosophy (Antelman, 2004); Education (Hajjem et al., 2006; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2010); Business (Hajjem et al., 2006; McCabe and Snyder, 2015); Communication studies (Zhang, 2006); Ecology (McCabe and Snyder, 2014; Norris et al., 2008); Biology (Frandsen, 2009b; Hajjem et al., 2006; McCabe and Snyder, 2014). |

Anther benefit of openness is that while research collaborations are essential to advancing knowledge, identifying and connecting with appropriate collaborators is not trivial. Open practices can make it easier for researchers to connect with one another by increasing the discoverability and visibility of one’s work, facilitating rapid access to novel data and software resources, and creating new opportunities to interact with and contribute to ongoing communal projects.

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level
It is useful, but not necessary, to be familiar with version control and particularly that chapter's section on GitHub.

## Credit

Handling datasets as persistently identified, independently published items is a key element for allowing citation and long term integration of datasets into text as well as supporting a variety of data management activities. It would be an incentive to the author if a data publication had the rank of a citeable publication, adding to their reputation and ranking among their peers.

The German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) developed and promotes the use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for datasets. A DOI name is used to cite and link to electronic resources (text as well as research data and other types of content). The DOI System differs from other reference systems commonly used on the Internet, such as the URL, since it is permanently linked to the object itself, not just to the place in which the object is located. As a major advantage, the use of the DOI system for registration permits the scientists and the publishers to use the same syntax and technical infrastructure for the referencing of datasets that are already established for the referencing of articles. The DOI system offers persistent links as stable references to scientific content and an easy way to connect the article with the underlying data.

[Citing data](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/cite-datasets) **Creative Commons**

The DOI System is an identifier scheme administered by the International DOI Foundation.

The task of managing DOI registers is delegated to registration agencies that each specialise in a type of resource. For research datasets, the registration agency is the DataCite Consortium.[39] The consortium is made up of libraries and data centres from across the globe, led by the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB). Among the services it provides are human and machine interfaces for simple end-user administration of DOI registrations. DataCite also collects metadata about each dataset it registers.[40] These metadata may be searched through a Web interface[41] or harvested using OAI-PMH.[42]

Any repository wishing to register DOIs needs to obtain a username and password from DataCite to gain access to the registration service. Alternatively, the organisation can manage its DOIs through a third-party service such as EZID.
While best practice has yet to emerge on some matters, certain conventions are already becoming established.

When organisations register a DOI for a resource, they should not introduce semantic elements into the suffix, especially not metadata that might change over time (e.g. publisher, archive, owner).
As DOIs are used to cite data as evidence, the resource to which a DOI points should also remain unchanged, with any new version receiving a new DOI.

Once an identifier has been assigned to (a version/snapshot of) a resource, ensure that it and any explanatory metadata remain static over time. Ensure that the identifiers remain unique and associated with the correct versions.

Assign identifiers to static datasets only when no further changes or corrections are expected (i.e. after quality control checks are complete). For dynamic datasets, assign identifiers when new snapshots or time slices are created, whether this is on a regular basis or on demand.

The world is witnessing a significant global transformation, facilitated by technology and digital media, and fueled by data and information. This transformation has enormous potential to foster more transparent, accountable, efficient, responsive, and effective research.
 Only a very small proportion of the original data is published in conventional scientific journals. Existing policies on data archiving notwithstanding, in today’s practice data are primarily stored in private files, not in secure institutional repositories, and effectively are lost to the public. This lack of access to scientific data is an obstacle to international research for two main reasons:

1. It is generally difficult or impossible to fully reproduce a scientific study without the original data.
2. It often causes unnecessary duplication of research efforts; large amounts of research funds are spent every year to recreate already existing data. Further it inhibits joint research activities on various aspects of the same problem.

Accordingly, there is an ongoing global data revolution that seeks to advance collaboration and the creation and expansion of effective, efficient research programs. Open data is crucial to meeting these objectives.
Open data means that the data is freely available on the internet permitting any user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, and re-use it for any other purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.
This represents a real shift in how research works. At the moment anyone who wishes to use scientific data from a researcher often has to contact that researcher and make a request. Open by default turns this on its head and says that there should be a presumption of publication for all. Researchers need to justify data that’s kept closed, for example for security or data protection reasons.
Free access to, and subsequent use of, data is of significant value to society and the economy, and that data should, therefore, be open by default. So, how do you go about making your data open?

### Steps to make your data open

#### Step 1: Make your data available

Put your data online. It should be easily discoverable and accessible, and made available without bureaucratic or administrative barriers, which can deter people from accessing the data. Choose a location to store the data which will ensure historical copies of datasets are preserved, archived, and kept accessible as long as they retain value. As much as possible researchers should provide data in its original, unmodified form.

Data should be free of charge, under an open license, (for example, those developed by Creative Commons) so it can be reused and remixed by other researchers. The data should be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost i.e. no expensive piece of software should be required to read the file as this may obstruct researchers who wish to work with the dataset.

#### Step 2: Make your data easy to understand

Having data available is of no use if it cannot be understood. For example a table of numbers is useless if there are no headings which describe what the columns/rows contain. Therefore you should ensure that open datasets include consistent core metadata, and that the data is fully described. This requires that all documentation accompanying data is written in clear, plain language, and that data users have sufficient information to understand the source, strengths, weaknesses, and analytical limitations of the data so that they can make informed decisions when using it.

#### Step 3: Make your data easy to use

The data should be made available in a modifiable, machine-readable format so that it can be effectively used and  manipulated.
It is also important to think about the file formats that information is provided in. Data should be presented in structured and standardized formats to support interoperability, traceability, and effective reuse. In many cases, this will include providing data in multiple, standardized formats, so that it can be processed by computers and used by people.

#### Step 4: Make your data citeable

Data should be considered legitimate, citable product of research. Making data citeable (and citing data yourself) facilitate giving scholarly credit; in scholarly literature, whenever and wherever a claim relies upon data, the corresponding data should be cited.
Data citations facilitate identification of, access to, and verification of the specific data that support a claim, making science more reproducible. Ensure that anyone wishing to cite a dataset you host can use a persistent identifier that you provide to do so.

A data citation should include a persistent method for identification that is unique, and widely understandable by a community.
There are several types of persistent identifier that could be used to identify datasets: examples include Handles, Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) and Persistent URLs (PURLs), all of which can be resolved to an Internet location. The scheme that is gaining most traction is the Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

Choose an identifier scheme which allows the identifier to be resolved to a URL. This URL should belong to a landing page that contains descriptive information about the dataset, as well as links or instructions for accessing it. You should also ensure that datasets are made citable and identifiable at an appropriate level of granularity, i.e it would be no use citing CERN's entire data repository as someone attempting to reproduce your work would not be able to find the data used in a specific piece of work without considerable difficulty. Where possible it should be possible to cite the data used, and only the data used.

### Barriers to data sharing

Sometimes it may not be possible to make data publicly available in its entirety or even in part. There are two main reasons this may be the case:

#### Privacy

Many fields of scientific disciplines involve working with sensitive personal data, medical research being the most obvious example.
Individuals must be protected from (re)identification via their personal data used for research. Anonamysation of the data may be sufficient in some cases, but ensuring that reidentification is not possible is becoming increasingly difficult due to technical progress, growing computational power and – ironically – more open data. For example reidentification may be possible via data-mining of accessible data and so-called quasi-identifiers, a set of (common) properties that are – in their combination – so specific that they can be used to identify.

Preserving privacy may still be possible if partial or generalised datasets are provided e.g. age bands instead of birth date or only the first two digits of postal codes. It may also be possible to provide the data in such a format that researchers can query it whist keeping the data itself closed, e.g. a user may be able to send a query to retrieve the mean of a dataset, but not be able to acess any of the individual datapoints.

#### National and commercially sensitive data

## Open Source software

Materials used: [1.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800) **Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)**

### What is open source software?

When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license. Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly.

In many scientific fields, widely used state-of-the-art data processing and analysis packages are hosted and developed openly, allowing virtually anyone to contribute. Perhaps the paradigmatic example is the scikit-learn Python package for machine learning (Pedregosa et al., 2011), which, in the space of just over five years, has attracted over 500 unique contributors, 20,000 individual code contributions, and 2,500 article citations. Producing a comparable package using a traditional closed-source approach would likely not be feasible, and would, at the very least, have required a budget of tens of millions of dollars. While scikit-learn is clearly an outlier, hundreds of other open-source scientific packages that support much more domain-specific needs depend in a similar fashion on unsolicited community contributions e.g., the NIPY group of projects in neuroimaging (Gorgolewski et al., 2016). Importantly, such contributions not only result in new functionality from which the broader scientific community can benefit, but also regularly provide their respective authors with greater community recognition, and lead to new project and employment opportunities.

### Why run/contribute to open source projects?

Much of open source work is volunteered. For example, someone might come across a bug in a project they use and submit a quick fix, or they might enjoy tinkering with an open source project in their spare time.

[why open](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/) **CC BY 3.0**

### Microeconomic motivations

Open source is in your best interest, whether you're an individual, a corporation, a small business, a non-profit, or a government agency:

* **Shift developers from low-value work to high-value work** - We like to say in open source that *all the easy problems have already been solved*. Blogging, content management, and operating systems are all problems with established (and mainstream) open source solutions, to name a few. While developers could spend their time reinventing wheels that the open source community have already perfected, it's far preferable to use the worlds best wheel, especially when that wheel comes at no cost to you. This frees researchers up to work on yet-unsolved challenges.

{: .table style="width: 50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" }

* [**Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow**](https://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2006/06/07/linuss-law-aka-many-eyes-make-all-bugs-shallow/) (Linus's Law) - [Empirically, open source tends to produce better quality software than its proprietary or alternative counterparts](http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html). When you write closed source software, the only developers that can potentially detect, diagnose, triage, and resolve software bugs are those that happen to be employed by the company that publishes the software (or more likely, the arms-length contractor they pay to build it). Open source provides three advantages: first, you have the opportunity to tap the knowledge of the world's best developers, not just those on one organization's payroll. Second, the number of potentially contributing developers and thus the potential knowledge pool is orders of magnitude larger. Finally, open source software gets adapted to a variety of use cases, not just the one the publisher originally intended, surfacing bugs and edge cases much more rapidly than traditional, predictive QA processes.

* [**Modern software development practices**](https://ben.balter.com/2015/09/21/open-source-behind-the-firewall/) - Open source software is more than simply "published" code. You'd be hard-pressed to find an open source project that follows outdated, waterfall, or rigid command-and-control development philosophies, still common in many large, bureaucratic organizations. By virtue of being distributed and unbridled by policy or technical debt, open source projects all but necessitate modern software development workflows. [These workflows](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/18/tools-to-empower-open-collaboration/) are electronic (meaning process is naturally captured and exposed), asynchronous (meaning decisions are time and location agnostic), and lock-free (meaning contributors can rapidly experiment without prior approval). These three workflow characteristics means more rapid development cycles and more frequent releases without sacrificing quality.

* **Open source is the future** - You'd be hard pressed to find a startup today worth it's venture capital funding not based, at least in part (if not largely) on open source. Open source isn't a fad, or a bunch of hippies out in California passing around tie-dye laptops like they would illicit substances. Open source is how modern organizations, and increasingly more traditional organizations build software. It's becoming exceedingly challenging to make the argument that five-or-ten years from now the technology landscape is going to be less collaborative and more closed. Heck, even Microsoft, [traditionally one of the most stark opponents to open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents), has [open sourced their primary development framework](https://microsoft.github.io/) (along with [Apple and Swift](https://swifteducation.github.io/)). Today, all the largest names in technology, from [IBM](https://ibm.github.io/), to [SAP](https://sap.github.io/), to [Adobe](https://adobe.github.io/) actively participate in the open source community. It's slightly inaccurate to say that "open source is the future". Open source has already won.

* **Patch on your own schedule** - So long as software is written by humans, bugs and security vulnerabilities are inevitable. When a vulnerability is discovered in a proprietary software project, you have to wait for the workday to begin in the company's timezone, for meetings to be held, tasks delegated, and code written, all before G&A teams like legal, sales, and marketing have to coordinate how to get the fix into the next regularly-scheduled release. For proprietary software, bugs and vulnerabilities affect the bottom line, and thus there's a disincentive to make their details widely publicized. With open source, not only can leaner, more agile, non-profit-oriented organization move faster, since you have access to the source code, you can often apply fixes, both large and small, at your own convenience, not at the convenience of the publishing organization's release cycle.

* **Upstream improvements** - If you consume open source software, it's in your best interest to contribute back. Contributions can be in the form of reporting bugs, or even submitting proposed fixes. Since software is written by humans, it's highly unlikely to be perfect, and even if so, likely doesn't satisfy every use case. Rather than forking the project and implementing changes into your own version (closed source), submitting bug reports and improvements upstream (open source) allows you to more easily continue to benefit from the subsequent fixes and improvements submitted by others.

GitHub Cofounder Tom Preston-Werner lays out some additional arguments in his post [Open Source (Almost) Everything](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/11/22/open-source-everything.html):

* **Force multiplier** - Open source is a force multiplier for your developers. This happens in three ways: First, when communities form around shared challenges, the diversity of ideas that naturally emerges surfaces better solutions than if the marketplace of ideas was limited to just your organization, meaning developers are working smarter. Second, exposing the problem space to other interested organizations provides additional human capital to tackle your challenge, meaning the solution has more developer hours thrown at it, at no additional cost to you. Finally, "more users means more use cases being explored, which means more robust code."

* **Modular** - Open source projects tend to be more modularly architected, improving both the flexibility, and the robustness of the code. When you're building software for a single use case, you're able to take some technical short cuts. The problem comes when you'd like to use that software in a different use case, or when your requirements change. Open source, by its nature, is built for a variety of use cases, environments, and users. This means more options (rather than hard coding defaults for a particular use), and a tendency to encourage more modularity (rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all feature set), resulting in greater flexibility and lower customization costs in the long run. Put another way, open source necessitates cleaner, more maintainable code. ["Even internal code should pretend to be open source code"](https://ben.balter.com/2012/06/26/why-you-should-always-write-software-as-open-source/).

* **Reduce duplication of effort** - You should focus on your core competency. What makes you unique or gives you an advantage? Everything else is the work everyone else is also doing, or put another way, the work you need to do so that you can do the work that you want to do. It doesn't have to be that way. Open source reduces duplication of efforts, both within an organization and across organizations, by allowing for individual components to be shared. Coca-Cola's secret sauce is the formula for its syrup, not its ability publish blog posts or post press releases. Using an open source CMS, or sharing their built-in-house blog components with the world, doesn't make Pepsi taste any better. "Less duplication means more work towards things that matter."

* **Great advertising** - Maintainers of successful open source projects are often seen as industry leaders, providing themselves with the ability to shape the conversation around a particular software problem and associating their brand with the preferred solution. 37Signals is known for creating Ruby on Rails. GitHub is known for creating [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com) ("Within two days it had 500 watchers on GitHub and 409 upvotes on Hacker News. This translates into goodwill for GitHub and more superfans than ever before").

* **Attract talent** - Developers want to work on yet-unsolved problems. Open source allows you to showcase to the developer community, the interesting challenges you face, and how you think about solving them. Open source developers can casually contribute to projects, to learn how you work, and what it's like developing software for a particular set of challenges. If they like what they see, there's a much better chance that they'll apply for a job, than if your organization was a black box when it comes to what it's like to work there. "Smart developers like to hang out with smart code."

* **Best technical interview possible** - Technical interviews traditionally involve working on a simulated problem that can be tackled in a set amount of time with little additional context. Such simulations, by definition, aren't real world use cases, nor do they show what working with an applicant would be like. Open source provides visibility into both how a candidate solves problems, and how they work with others. You can hire much more confidently if, for the past six months, the candidate has been contributing to the project you want them work on, and you like their work. "\[T]he best technical interview possible is the one you don't have to do because the candidate is already kicking ass on one of your open source projects."

### Macroeconomic motivations

By combining and augmenting parallel or related efforts, open source makes a society more efficient at producing higher quality software:

* **Efficiency** - Many of the Microeconomic arguments above, in the aggregate, have a macroeconomic impact. When firms work more efficiently, the economy produces more (and better) software, software that can in turn, improve lives. If you believe that all the easy problems have already been solved, then on a macroeconomic level, open source allows you to move firms from lower-level work to higher level, yet-unsolved challenges. The results of this higher level work tends to be disruptive, rather than iterative, creating the churn that invigorates the economy. If every technology company must devote a few years of R & D solving the same 5–10 problems, that delays (or at the very least shifts capital from) the company's ability to be productive and produce technology that's valuable to society, not to mention, it raises the barrier for new market entrants to offer alternatives to established firms.

* **Stand on the shoulders of giants** - Today, innovative technology, the type of technology that improves quality of life, isn't created in a vacuum. Even closed source technology, from the cell phone in your pocket to the car you drive to the Fortune 500 company that produced them, rely heavily on open source (don't believe me? Take a look at your phone's "settings → about" page). Just as algebra and trigonometry being unencumbered by private sector copyright gave way to everything from calculus to quantum physics, open source allows developers to take already-solved problems as a given, to rely on the knowledge of experts beyond their own domain of expertise, and unlocks their potential to create new inventions, otherwise not possible.

* **Fuel the marketplace of ideas** - Software is nothing more than technical knowledge. There was once a time when alchemists would withhold the results of their work, claiming their discoveries as proprietary. Each had to learn the hard way the result on the human body of drinking lead. When those alchemists began sharing their work, we began calling them scientists, and the scientific revolution was born. The same is true of mathematics, literature, and computer software. Two developers working individually may come up with two solutions to a given problem, but through dialog and collaboration, each bringing their own knowledge and experience, may discover three, five, or ten solutions to the same, and society is better as a result.

### Moral motivations

The formal name for open source is [free/libre open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). As such, open source motivations have a strong moral component:

* **Free as in speech, not as in beer** - Open source software is not without cost. When open source software is called "free", it is a reference to the rights the software consumers receive, not the cost they must pay. Adobe's Flash player, for example, is free software in the economic sense, but is still at the core of proprietary (non-free) software (and formats). Specifically, [free software refers to four core freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html): the freedom to run the software, the freedom to study and modify the software, the freedom to redistribute the software, and the freedom to distribute your modifications.

  As [the Free Software Movement argues](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html), non-free software risks software that can control the user (with the publisher controlling the software). This creates the potential for the software becoming an instrument of unjust power. Today, it's not uncommon for proprietary software to spy on users (e.g., phoning home), to restrict them (e.g., DRM), to censor them (e.g., corporate firewalls), or to take advantage of them (e.g., unskippable commercials). This becomes even more important as the internet of things emerges, and risks turning the world into "the internet of telemarketers" or "the internet of snoopers". Free software places power back in the hands of users and ensures users control the software they use, not the other way around.

* **Obligation to give back** - Open source is the give-a-penny-take-a-penny jar of software. If you consume open source, be it a server, a desktop publishing application, or a software library, you have an obligation to give back to the community. After all, without the contribution of others, the micro- and macroeconomic motivations would no longer hold true, and open source as we know it would cease to exist. This is [the Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), or in traditional philosophical terms, a [categorical imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative).

* **Governments should give what they've developed to the people who pay for their development** - If the development costs are paid by a government, then there's an additional argument for giving back. Governments take money (taxes) to perform services for their populace. For example, the US federal government was established through its Constitution by *we the people* to perform a number of important tasks. If the populace (we the people) are paying for the development of software, it stands to reason that we should receive what we paid to develop, including the software we paid to develop.

* **Teaching the next generation** - Many of the industry's most prominent engineers today cut their teeth by learning from open source. When software's underlying code is made available for inspection, consumers can learn how their favorite software works and computer science courses can analyze how the industry's cutting edge technology is built. This goes a long way to train the next generation of software engineers (who without open source would be left guessing at the inner-workings of prior iterations).

### Transparency motivations

Open source allows for greater transparency of process, whether that's the transparency necessary to check a government action or the quasi-governmental function of a private company's software.

* **Showing your work** - As the government increasingly relies on technology to regulate industries and deliver citizen services, being able to see the underlying algorithms and processes are essential to checking the government's work. If a closed-source software package is used to calculate my taxes or allocate broadcast frequencies, how do I know that the process, *our process*, is fair and accurate? Whereas human processes can't be copyrighted, when close source, such processes become a black box, minimizing the potential for a citizen counterbalance.

* **Positions of public trust** - As the software produced by private corporations are increasingly placed in positions of public trust, the transparency obligation extends into the private sector as well. Did the voting machine accurately count my vote? When given a lose-lose choice, does the self-driving car conform to community norms? For example, if a closed-source software package is used to compare DNA at a crime scene, unlike a medical expert who can be cross examined, that proprietary algorithm is shielded from scrutiny by copyright (or patent) law. Open source, at least partial open source of particular components, will become essential as private companies automate quasi-government functions.

### Participatory motivations

Open source affords software stakeholders, both technical and non-technical, the opportunity to shape any given software development project:

* **Direct democracy** - True direct democracy (where every citizen votes on every issue) isn't tenable given the size of most democracies. Nor have citizen been able to participate directly in most issues, due to technical constraints. Open source changes that by allowing software stakeholders to participate directly in the software development process (as software is increasingly relied on to codify regulatory and service-delivery preferences and norms). Think the process of buying health care is confusing? Open an issue. Believe the government should use more open source, submit a pull request. The White House is already doing this for many IT-centric policies like the Digital Services Playbook, HTTPS, and open data policies.

* **Customer feedback** - Open source empowers consumers to have a combined, powerful voice in the private sector development process. Think of it like Yelp for software. Without Yelp, a restaurants is free to upset a single customer. At most, that dissatisfied patrons could dissuade 5–10 other potential patrons. In a post-Yelp world, customers read the reviews of strangers before they choose where to go. Open source amplifies the voice of software consumers within the consumer-publisher relationship. Not to mention, the feedback the private company receives can go towards better informing product decisions and improve the overall product. Open source gives companies a direct line to their most passionate customers.

### Personal motivations

If you're a developer (or an aspiring developers), open source can provide an easy (and free) onramp to and path for personal growth within the software development community:

* **Learn to code** - Open source is a great way to learn how to code. Want to know how your favorite website works? Hitting "view source" in your web browser can go a long way to point you in the right direction. You can read the documentation of the software that powers it, and potentially even stand up your own clone. Want to learn more? Join the local meetup for the framework or language. Better still, submit a pull request to the project to fix a small bug or add a new feature. While there are certainly time and opportunity costs involved, all of this comes without any direct cost to the aspiring developer, at least not in terms of software, and is infinitely more inclusive than doing the same within a proprietary community, especially as an outsider. There's a reason nearly every coding school today outside of traditional academia teaches open source.

* **It's fun** - According to Wikipedia, [open source is a hobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies#cite_ref-8). In fact, open source has traditionally had the reputation of being the product of hobbyists (although I'd argue that's less true today). Open source is fun. If you're [a hacker](https://ben.balter.com/2013/02/04/what-is-a-hacker/) it provides an endless set of ever-changing set of Rubix cubes for you to solve on weekends. Just as puzzles (both crossword and jigsaw) provide bite-sized intellectual escapes, the order and symmetry of open source can often be a rock garden of code (especially for those for which football is an embarrassing non-starter).

There are many reasons why you should prefer consuming, publishing, collaborating on, and supporting open source, and if yours isn't listed here, I'd love to hear (and add) it. Whatever your reason, it's clear open source isn't the next big thing. Open source is already here.

#### Improve existing skills
Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project.

#### Meet people who are interested in similar things
Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years. Many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.

#### Find mentors and teach others
Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.

#### Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career)
By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.

#### Learn people skills
Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.

#### It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones
You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.

### How to run your own open source project

You can open source an idea, a work in progress, or after years of being closed source. At the most basic level all you need to do is but your code online somewhere that is likely to last a long time. A popular place to do this GitHub (see the chapter on version control).

You MUST include a license file stating that anyone has permission to use, copy and modify your work. Without this no one can legaly use your work and so it isn't open source. [This](https://choosealicense.com/) website offers a very simple mechanism to help you pick the best license for your project.

You SHOULD include a readme file where you include useful information about what the project is, how to use it and how to contribute to it. Switching between projects in your work is common, let alone that you might need to poke at your own previous projects from time to time. This information will also assist you collaborators, and your future employer might want to check your existing GitHub projects.

Here's a list of the main things a readme should include:

- The project name and what it is. This will greatly help someone that comes across it to get an idea of the project. Include a few key points that describe the main features of the project and what are the main features you're implementing.
This helps to quickly compare other projects with yours and to give an idea that why the project exists in the first place.
- Instructions on how to install the project. The installer might be a collaborator, someone that comes across and is interested in the project, or even you if you get a new machine and need to re-install your project. Nevertheless, it's a total waste of both of your resources to start figuring out how to just get started with the project. This should also include any prerequisites that will be needed to run the project.
The best thing you can do is to just write up the installation instructions when you first do them yourself, and you'll quickly save hours of work in the future.
- Instructions for how to run the project and any associated tests. If you've been working on your project it may seem obvious how to run it, but this will likely not be the case for someone coming across it for the first time.
- Links to related material
- List of authors/contributors to the project, possibly with contact information
- Acknowledgements

If you intend for other people to collaborate on your project (as opposed to just making your code available and considering it complete) then you SHOULD include contributing guidelines and most likely a code of conduct.

Writing your contributing guidelines
A CONTRIBUTING file tells your audience how to participate in your project. For example, you might include information on:

How to file a bug report (try using issue and pull request templates)
How to suggest a new feature
How to set up your environment and run tests
In addition to technical details, a CONTRIBUTING file is an opportunity to communicate your expectations for contributions, such as:

The types of contributions you’re looking for
Your roadmap or vision for the project
How contributors should (or should not) get in touch with you
Using a warm, friendly tone and offering specific suggestions for contributions (such as writing documentation, or making a website) can go a long way in making newcomers feel welcomed and excited to participate.

For example, Active Admin starts its contributing guide with:

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It’s people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool.

In the earliest stages of your project, your CONTRIBUTING file can be simple. You should always explain how to report bugs or file issues, and any technical requirements (like tests) to make a contribution.

Over time, you might add other frequently asked questions to your CONTRIBUTING file. Writing down this information means fewer people will ask you the same questions over and over again.

For more help with writing your CONTRIBUTING file, check out @nayafia’s contributing guide template or @mozilla’s “How to Build a CONTRIBUTING.md”.

Link to your CONTRIBUTING file from your README, so more people see it. If you place the CONTRIBUTING file in your project’s repository, GitHub will automatically link to your file when a contributor creates an issue or opens a pull request.

Finally, a code of conduct helps set ground rules for behaviour for your project's participants. This is especially valuable if you're launching an open source project for a community or company. A code of conduct empowers you to facilitate healthy, constructive community behaviour, which will reduce your stress as a maintainer.

For more information, check out our [Code of Conduct guide](../code-of-conduct/).

In addition to communicating _how_ you expect participants to behave, a code of conduct also tends to describe who these expectations apply to, when they apply, and what to do if a violation occurs.

Much like open source licenses, there are also emerging standards for codes of conduct, so you don't have to write your own. The [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/) is a drop-in code of conduct that is used by [over 40,000 open source projects](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters), including Kubernetes, Rails, and Swift. No matter which text you use, you should be prepared to enforce your code of conduct when necessary.

Paste the text directly into a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file in your repository. Keep the file in your project's root directory so it's easy to find, and link to it from your README.

### How to contribute to other's open source projects

- Find an open issue to tackle
- Ask if you can help write a new feature
- Automate project setup
- Improve tooling and testing
- Review code on other people’s submissions
- Write tutorials for how a project can be used

You don’t have to contribute code
A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. You’ll do the project a huge favour by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!

- Write and improve the project’s documentation
- Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used
- Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list
- Link to duplicate issues, and suggest new issue labels, to keep things organized
- Go through open issues and suggest closing old ones, like @nzakas did for ESLint
- Ask clarifying questions on recently opened issues to move the discussion forward
- Answer questions about the project on e.g., Stack Overflow (like this Postgres example) or Reddit
- Answer questions for people on open issues

For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to open source is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely.

Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.

Anatomy of an open source project
Every open source community is different.

Spending years on one open source project means you’ve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.

That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.

A typical open source project has the following types of people:

- Author: The person/s or organization that created the project
- Owner: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
- Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
- Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
- Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.
-
Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.

A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.

- LICENSE: By definition, every open source project must have an open source license. If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.
- CONTRIBUTING: Whereas READMEs help people use the project, contributing docs help people contribute to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT: The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants’ behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
- Other documentation: There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.
Finally, open source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.

- Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.
- Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.
- Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, “How do I…“ or “What do you think about…“ instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.
- Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

#### Find a project to contribute to

If you’ve never contributed to open source before, take some advice from U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who once said, “Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.”

Contributing to open source happens at all levels, across projects. You don’t need to overthink what exactly your first contribution will be, or how it will look.
Instead, start by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. The projects you’ll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to.
Within those projects, whenever you catch yourself thinking that something could be better or different, act on your instinct.

Open source isn’t an exclusive club; it’s made by people just like you. “Open source” is just a fancy term for treating the world’s problems as fixable. You might scan a README and find a broken link or a typo. Or you’re a new user and you noticed something is broken, or an issue that you think should really be in the documentation. Instead of ignoring it and moving on, or asking someone else to fix it, see whether you can help out by pitching in. That’s what open source is all about!

## Open Access

[About open access](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-access) **Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International**

Open access refers to the practice of making peer-reviewed scholarly research and literature freely available online to anyone interested in reading it. Open access has two different versions—gratis and libre.

Gratis open access is simply making research available for others to read without having to pay for it. However, it does not grant the user the right to make copies, distribute, or modify the work in any way beyond fair use. Libre open access is gratis, meaning the research is available free of charge, but it goes further by granting users additional rights, usually via a Creative Commons license, so that people are free to reuse and remix the research. There are varying degrees of what may be considered Libre open access. For example, some scholarly articles may permit all uses except commercial use, some may permit all uses except derivative works, and some may permit all uses and simply require attribution. While some would argue that Libre open access should be free of any copyright restrictions (except attribution), other scholars consider a work that removes at least some permission barriers to be libre.

In addition to the gratis/libre distinction regarding users’ rights to a work, there are also distinctions regarding the venue in which open access works are published and archived—green and gold. Green open access involves authors self-archiving their articles by sharing them on their own website, or more preferably, in their institution's Institutional Repository or in some other public archive. Gold open access articles are published in a journal that is open access, which means the journal will handle hosting and distributing the journal article in a free and open manner. Gold open access can come with a cost—some gold open access journals have publication fees that need to paid by the author (or the author's employer) to cover the cost of publishing the article. These publication fees can be costly, but thankfully less than a third of gold open access journals have a publication fee. Currently, most Gold open access journals are still publishing gratis (free of charge to read) as opposed to libre (free of charge to read, copy, distribute, etc).

Why does open access matter?
New knowledge is built by synthesizing current scholarship and then building upon it. If the current scholarship is behind a pay-wall, only those who can afford access can truly contribute to moving our knowledge of a subject forward. Non-Open Access Academic journals can be very expensive, making scholarly research a costly undertaking for someone with a limited research budget. Academic libraries have subscriptions to a large number of scholarly journals, and many allow members of the local community to access the library's journals if they visit the library in person, but the ever rising costs of journal subscriptions is a burden on libraries' budgets. A single institution's annual subscription can cost university libraries anywhere from $5,000 to $600,000. Instead of being stuck behind a paywall imposed by often exorbitant subscription prices, Open Access research can be read by anyone with access to the Internet. Open Access levels the playing field so that an independent scholar, an adjunct faculty member at a small college, and a tenured faculty member at a major research university have the same level of access.

Who benefits from open access?
Scholars, students, and the general public benefit from open access. It can help save a language or index North American archaeological data. If you are interested in dinosaurs, open access provides you with information about the most newly-discovered dinosaur species. Open access means that professors and students can access a larger body of research without having to wait for (possibly lengthy) inter-library loan requests. And open access is not just beneficial to academia. If your local elected officials have access to studies about how things worked or did not work in another city, they can make more informed policy decisions. If your healthcare provider can freely read the latest medical research, they can provide you with more up-to-date medical advice and treatments. Really, everyone benefits from open access policies.

What can I do to encourage open access?
Anyone can help raise awareness by installing the open access button in their web browser and sharing it via social media. Open Access Week is an international event that occurs online, in late October every year. It offers ideas for students, researchers, funders, administrators, librarians, and others to connect and show their support for open access. It is a good opportunity to learn more about open access and to share with others.

If you are a scholar, consider submitting your work to a journal that is open access. If you are doing research about open source, there are several open access journals to choose from. For the life sciences, F1000Research is an excellent choice and is quite innovative. Also, the journal Nature Methods has recently embraced openness in a big way. If none of those are a match for your research, you can explore the Directory of Open Access Journals to find the right journal for you. If you cannot find a journal that is right for you, please consider self-archiving by adding your journal article to your institution's open access Institutional Repository. And if your institution does not have an institutional repository, advocate for the creation of one.

Open Access seeks to return scholarly publishing to its original purpose: to spread knowledge and allow that knowledge to be built upon.  Price barriers should not prevent students (or anyone) from getting access to research they need.  Open Access, and the open availability and searchability of scholarly research that it entails, will have a significant positive impact on everything from education to the practice of medicine to the ability of entrepreneurs to innovate.  

Developing countries are home to the same groups that require access to research in order to thrive (students, researchers, doctors, etc), but they often face much steeper access barriers.  While many institutions in the developed world can afford journal budgets of several million or more dollars, institutions in developing countries must make do with a fraction of that budget.

#### Researchers

Better visibility and higher impact for your scholarship: Studies have shown a significant increase in citations when articles are made openly available.  Below is a chart from a recent summary analysis that shows the Open Access citation advantage in different fields2:

Avoiding duplication: no researcher wants to waste time and money conducting a study if they know it has been attempted elsewhere. But, duplication of effort is all-too-possible when researchers can’t effectively communicate with one another and make results known to others in their field and beyond.

Research is useless if it’s not shared: even the best research is ineffectual if others aren’t able to read and build on it.  When price barriers keep articles locked away, science cannot achieve its full potential.

Text mining: today millions of articles are published every year, so many that a researcher could only hope to read a small subset of all articles in a given field.  Text mining could be very beneficial by giving researchers an over-arching view of a particular field and uncovering trends and connections within their own field and between seemingly unrelated fields that no human researcher could discern.  However, when many articles are inaccessible due to subscription barriers or being posted in non computer-readable formats, these tools cannot reach their true potential.

#### The public

Return on our investment: making research publicly available as soon as possible will allow other researchers to build on new ideas as soon as they are published, while in the current system these ideas might remained locked away and unable to advance to state of the field.  To have the greatest possible impact, the research we fund as taxpayers must be made available to the largest possible audience to make use of and build upon new ideas.

Exercising our right to research: as taxpayers who pay for much of the research published in journals, we have a collective right to access the information resulting from our investment.

#### Publishers

Demonstrated benefits: numerous publishers, both non-profit and for-profit, voluntarily make their articles openly available at the time of publication or within 6-12 months.  Many have switched from a closed, subscription model to an open one as a strategic business decision to increase their journal's exposure and impact, and have done so with great success5.

#### Students

A complete education: students in any discipline need access to the latest research to have a complete education in their field of study and hit the ground running after graduation. Limited access to research makes students settle for the information that is available rather than that which is most relevant.  Open Access can ensure students get the best possible education and are not artificially limited by the selection of scholarly journals their campuses are able to provide.

If your professors can’t read it, they can’t teach it: when professors can’t access the most recent research, they are deprived of the opportunity to bring that material into the classroom.  With science advancing at an ever-increasing pace, it’s crucial that professors have access to cutting-edge research, so students’ education isn’t outdated before they even finish a course.  This problem was recently highlighted by Dr. Gary Ward in a press conference for the Federal Research Public Access Act:

In my role as educator, I often find myself teaching my graduate and medical students what I have access to rather than what they most need to know. Just as one example, in a recent lecture I was preparing for our medical students... I was only able to access about two thirds of the articles that I needed in order to make sure that I was providing these budding young doctors with everything they needed to know about the subject. I can tell you that’s extremely frustrating to me as an educator and it’s clearly not in the best interests of my students. This problem isn’t unique to the University of Vermont. Every academic institution faces this problem – from the best-funded private institutions down to the small liberal arts colleges and community colleges. It’s just a question of degree.

- Dr. Gary Ward, Professor of Microbiology & Molecular Genetics, and Co-Director, Vermont Center for Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Vermont1

Research for papers: it’s a familiar story; you’re writing a paper for class and you need to cite articles from peer-reviewed journals. Eventually, you find an article that looks good — maybe via a search engine, a footnote from another source, or a reference in an index. You search the Web for the full text, but you can’t get past the abstract. You look on your library’s Web site but they don’t have a subscription. You’re stuck. Maybe that article would have been a major source for your work — you’ll never know. You don’t have access.  Open Access changes that. No more worrying about whether you’re on the campus network or if your library has a subscription. If you’re online, you have  access, period — anywhere in the world.

The current system puts students from smaller schools at a disadvantage: due to the staggering price of journal subscriptions, not even the largest, most well-funded institutions can provide their students with the complete scholarly record.  Students at smaller or less well-funded colleges and universities must make do with their fraction of access their library can afford.  Students at community colleges, who are a significant portion of students in higher education, suffer even more severely.

Researching beyond the degree: many students, especially on the graduate level, pursue degrees in order to become qualified researchers.  Whether they become professors, doctors, lawyers, or entrepreneurs, they will continuously rely on access to research in order to make an impact in their respective field.  Yet, students' access to journals expires along with their library card at graduation. If they take a job at another university, that institution may have a very different level of access than what they need, and if they take a job outside of the university setting, they will no longer have the library to provide them any access to journals.

#### What is it?

Open Access to publications means that research publications like articles and books can be accessed online, free of charge by any user, with no technical obstacles \(such as mandatory registration or login to specific platforms\). At the very least, such publications can be read online, downloaded and printed. Ideally, additional rights such as the right to copy, distribute, search, link, crawl and mine should also be provided. Open Access can be realised through two main non-exclusive routes:

* Green Open Access \(self-archiving\): The published work or the final peer-reviewed manuscript that has been accepted for publication is made freely and openly accessible by the author, or a representative, in an online repository. Some publishers request that Open Access be granted only after an embargo period has elapsed. This embargo period can last anywhere between several months and several years. For publications that have been deposited in a repository but are under embargo, usually at least the metadata are openly accessible.

* Gold Open Access \(Open Access publishing\): The published work is made available in Open Access mode by the publisher immediately upon publication. The most common business model is based on one-off payments by authors \(commonly called APCs – article processing charges – or BPCs – book processing charges\). Where Open Access content is combined with content that requires a subscription or purchase, in particular in the context of journals, conference proceedings and edited volumes, this is called hybrid Open Access.

#### Rationale

One of the most common ways to disseminate research results is by writing a manuscript and publishing it in a journal, conference proceedings or book. For many years those publications were available to the public under a payment by means of a subscription fee or individually. However, at the turn of the 21st century a new movement appeared with a clear objective: make all the research results available to the public without any restriction. This movement took the name of Open Access and established two initial strategies to achieve its final goal. The first strategy was to provide tools and assistance to scholars to deposit their refereed journal articles in open electronic repositories. The second one was to launch a new generation of journals using copyright and other tools to ensure permanent open access to all the articles they publish. As a result of the first strategy we see self-archiving practices: researchers depositing and disseminating papers in institutional or subject based repositories. And as a result of the second strategy we have seen the creation of the open access journals that provide free access to readers and allow reuse of their contents without almost any restriction.

Beyond those two strategies established in the [Budapest Open Access Initiative](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read) in 2002, we have seen the growth of new methods of dissemination. Among them, we find the publication of preprints through institutional repositories and preprint servers. Preprints are widely used in physical sciences and now emerging in life sciences and other fields. Preprints are documents that have not been peer reviewed but are considered as a complete scientific publication in a first stage. Some of the preprints servers include open peer review services and the availability to post new versions of the initial paper once reviewed by peers. Following this trend of including open peer review processes in preprint servers we have seen the development of new publishing platforms supported by funders like the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/) or the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation ](https://gatesopenresearch.org/). Even the European Commission is planning to to launch a [publishing platform for the Horizon 2020 funded projects](https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/pdf/information_note_platform_public.pdf).

The choice of a journal or a publishing platform may affect the availability and accessibility of the research results. There are several options for researchers when deciding where, when, and how to publish their findings. It is fundamental to know all the implications to avoid future problems.

The rise of many business models around open access journals poses a lot of misunderstandings and uncertainties to the researchers when deciding where to publish. Moreover, paywalled journals offer individual open access models, the so-called hybrid model, that brings more complexity when deciding where and how to publish.

Regarding self archiving, researchers are confused by the different requirements established by the publishers in relation with version of a paper that they can deposit in a repository and when this version can be available to the public. This delay in allowing public access to the full text is often called embargo period and it is not uniform for all the journals. Institutions who provide a repository for its researchers should facilitate self archiving practices by digesting all those publisher requirements.

### Learning objectives

1. Learn about the different options a researcher has when deciding where to publish a paper, including funder requirements.

2. Be able to decide if a paper can be published before peer review, for example in a preprint server. Trainees will learn how to determine which options they have according to their disciplines/journal policies, and if there would be consequences afterwards that might jeopardize final publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

3. Trainees will learn how to discover the differences between policies of peer-reviewed journals, particularly when submitting something available as a preprint. They will learn the differences among open-access journals, such as which require a fee for submission/publication and which licenses they use.

4. Trainees will learn about the implications of publishing in paywalled journals for future self-archiving in a repository, and the publisher requirements in terms of version and embargo. Trainees will also learn about hybrid open-access journals.

5. \(optional depending on audience\) Trainees will learn about open-access opportunities when publishing in books, since this is the main avenue of dissemination for some disciplines.

6. Trainees will learn about different business models used by open-access journals, and opportunities for obtaining funds to support publishing if needed.

#### Key components

#### Knowledge

**Repositories and self-archiving**

At the beginning of 2018 more than 4600 repositories are available for researchers to self-archive their publications according to the [Registry of Open Access Repositories](http://roar.eprints.org/). In this list we can find institutional repositories, subject based or thematic repositories and harvesters. The first ones are generally managed by research performing institutions to provide to their community a place to archive and share openly papers and other research outputs. Subject based repositories are usually managed by research communities and most of the contents are related to a certain discipline. Finally, harvesters aggregate content from different repositories becoming sites to perform general searches and build other value-added services. It is fundamental for a repository to be harvested to acquire more visibility. For that purpose, repository managers need to follow standard guidelines regarding the use of metadata and the values of these metadata. Moreover, institutional repositories can be linked with other information databases to increase discoverability, for example [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) offers the possibility to link its registers by the [linkout project](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/linkout/doc/IR-application.shtml). Repositories have always been seen as an alternative way to access to scientific publications when accessing to the original source is not affordable. Currently there are tools like the [Unpaywall](http://unpaywall.org/) browser extension that facilitates this alternative.

When choosing a journal to publish research results, researchers should take a moment to read the journal policy regarding the transfer of copyright. Many journals still require for publication that authors transfer full copyright. This transfer of rights implies that authors must ask for permission to reuse their own work beyond what is allowed by the applicable law and unless there are some uses already granted. Among those granted uses we can find teaching purposes, sharing with colleagues, and especially how researchers can self-archive their papers in repositories. Sometimes there a common policy among all the journals published by the same publishers but in general journals have their own policy, especially when they are published on behalf of a scientific society. When looking at the self-archiving conditions we must identify two key issues: the version of the paper that can be deposited and when it can be publicly available.

Regarding the version, some journals allow the dissemination of the submitted version, also known as preprint, and they allow its replacement for a reviewed version once the final paper has been published. Due to the increase of policies requiring access to research results, most of the journals allow to deposit the accepted version of the paper, also known as the author manuscript or postprint. This version is the final text once the peer review process has ended but it has not the final layout of the publication. Finally some journals allow researchers to deposit the final published version, also known as the version of record.

In relation to the moment to make the paper publicly available, many journals establish a period of time from its original publication: the embargo period, which can range from zero to 60 months. Some journals include or exclude embargoes depending on the versions. For instance the accepted version could be made publicly available after publication but the published version must wait 12 months.

**Open Access publishing**

The number of Open Access Journals has increased during the last years becoming a real option for researchers when deciding where to publish their findings. According to the Directory of Open Access Journals \([DOAJ](http://www.doaj.org)\), currently there are more than 11,000 journals. Nevertheless is important to remark that an open access journal must provide free access to its contents but it also must license them to allow reusability. No legal notice must be legally understood as "all rights reserved". Although the definition of an open access journal does not include any condition about the business model, there is a fact that those journals are commonly known as journal where you have to pay to publish. This misconception is due to the fact that the most successful journals and the ones that got the highest impact follow this model. Nevertheless, a recent study shows that the majority of journals registered in DOAJ do not charge any fee for publication \(Data available [here](https://sustainingknowledgecommons.org/2018/02/06/doaj-apc-information-as-of-jan-31-2018/)\).

Currently many paywalled journals offer individual open access options to researchers once the paper is accepted after peer review. Those options include the publication under a free content license and free accessibility to anyone since its first publication. This model is commonly known as the hybrid model because in the same issue of a journal, readers can find open access and paywalled contributions. Usually publishers ask for a fee to open individual contributions. Recent studies show that the hybrid fees are higher than the average of the article processing charges in some pure open access journals \([Jahn & Tullney 2016](https://doi.org/10/bnqm)\). One of the reasons researchers choose the hybrid model is to fulfil some of the requirements of funders policy, especially the ones requiring immediate public access to research results or short embargo periods.

Some funders, have decided to establish their own publishing platforms to provide their grantees with a place to release their findings. In general, to publish in those platforms costs around 1000 € and all the materials are released under a CC BY license. The publication is not limited to papers, researchers can include, for instance, data and software. There is no previous peer review process and therefore researchers publish documents that only pass through a limited editorial review to check the format but there is not an evaluation on the content. Peer review is done in a transparent way allowing anyone to see who wrote it and what the comments were. After the open peer review, authors can upload updated versions of their papers accordingly.

Some disciplines prefer to use other formats than journals to publish results, for instance books. Initially, publishers were very reluctant to allow researchers to self archive a full book or even a book chapter. However, [some publishers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Lq_zzaGqge8SdY1DX-YXTN43JLn75jf2OhidJqXM60/edit#gid=142126524) have begun to adopt policies to facilitate it. On the other hand, some university presses have shifted their publication model to open access to increase the visibility of their contents, especially monographs. This change can be explained as an answer to the cuts in some of the expenditures in monographs due to the restrictions in library budgets. A common model for this open access university presses is to provide a free version in PDF and sell paper or epub versions \(see for instance UCL\). Moreover the creation of the [Directory of Open Access Books](https://doabooks.org/) have increased their discoverability. In a similar way than other journal initiatives, there have appeared some projects to join forces to establish a common fund to build open access monographs, for instance [Knowledge Unlatched](http://www.knowledgeunlatched.org/).

#### Skills

* Choose a suitable repository or server to post a preprint according to your discipline

* Self archive a publication in a suitable repository, institutional or subject-based, following the possible restrictions posed by the publisher, mainly related to the allowed version to be deposit and the embargo period

* Choose among the options of open-access journals and publishing platforms available

* Find available funds or discounts to publish in open-access journals if needed

#### Questions, obstacles, and common misconceptions

Q: "If I publish my work as a preprint, it won’t be acknowledged - I will only receive credit for a peer-reviewed journal article."

A: Many funders are acknowledging the growing presence of preprint publishing in their policies: Howard Hughes Medical Institute \(HHMI\), Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council \(UK\) and the National Institutes of Health \(NIH\) announced policies allowing researchers to cite their own preprints in grant applications and reports \([Luther 2017](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2017/04/18/stars-aligning-preprints/)\). In addition, preprints help establish priority of results and may increase the impact - and citation count - of a later peer-reviewed article \([McKiernan 2016](https://doi.org/10/gbqsng)\).

There are still some researchers reluctant to deposit other versions than the final published version. It is important to inform them about the copyright implications when they sign a transfer document.

Avoid the misconception of understanding an open-access journal as a journal where authors must pay to publish. The author-pay model is just one of the existing business models for an open-access journal. You might show data about the number of journals that do not ask for a publication fee \(for example, as of 31 January 2018, [DOAJ reports](https://sustainingknowledgecommons.org/2018/02/06/doaj-apc-information-as-of-jan-31-2018/) that 71% of the 11,001 open-access journals listed require no publishing charge\). You may want to show other business models like the [SCOAP3 Initiative](https://scoap3.org/), the [LingOA project](http://www.lingoa.eu), or the [Open Library of Humanities](https://www.openlibhums.org/).

The use of publishing platforms has implications for research evaluation, the peer-review process, and the role of publishers. There are still many research assessments based on journal metrics and therefore this new way of publishing challenges those evaluations. Moreover the fact that peer review is completely transparent allows readers to identify reviewers and track the versioning of the paper. Finally, if those platforms become the common tool to publish results, publishers would need to redefine their role in the scholarly communication process.

The hybrid model is very controversial and it could raise a lot of questions about the costs, possible double-dipping, and the use \(or lack\) of licensing.
