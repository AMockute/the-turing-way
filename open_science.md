## Summary

Open Science aims to transform science by making research more reproducible, transparent, re-usable, collaborative, accountable and closer to society. It is about the way research is carried out, disseminated, deployed and transformed by digital tools.  The OECD defines Open Science as:  “to make the primary outputs of publicly funded research results – publications and the research data – publicly accessible in digital format with no or minimal restriction”, but it is more than that. Open Science is frequently defined as an umbrella term that involves various movements aiming to remove the barriers for sharing any kind of output, resources, methods or tools, at any stage of the research process.

Features of Open Science
- Open Notebooks - an emerging practice, documenting and sharing the experimental process of trial and error;
- Open Data - managing research data in a way that optimises access, discoverability and sharing for use and re-use;
- Open Research Software - documenting research code and routines, and making them freely accessible and available for collaboration;
- Open Access - making all published outputs freely accessible for maximum use and impact.

In order to achieve this openness in science, each element of the research process should:
- Be publicly available: it is difficult to use and benefit from knowledge hidden behind barriers such as passwords;
- Be re-usable: research outputs need to be licensed appropriately so that prospective users know clearly any limitations on re-use;
- Be transparent and have appropriate metadata to provide clear statements of how research output was produced, and can be re-used.

## How this will help you/ why this is useful

There are five main schools of thought motivating open practises to benefit scientific research:

| School                     | Belief               | Aim                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure | Efficient research depends on the available tools and applications. | Creating openly available platforms, tools and services for scientists. |
| Pragmatic | Knowledge-creation could be more efficient if scientists worked together. | Opening up the process of knowledge creation. |
| Measurement | Scientific contributions today need alternative impact measurements. | Developing an alternative metric system for scientific impact. |
| Democratic | The access to knowledge is unequally distributed. | Making knowledge freely available for everyone. |
| Public | Science needs to be made accessible to the public. | Making science accessible for citizens. |

Open practises also benefits the researchers that propagate them. For example there is evidence that open access articles are cited more, as shown by the metastudy presented in the figure [below](open_access_figure).

<a name="open_access_figure"></a>
| ![open_acess_citatations](open_acess_citatations.jpg) |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |
| The relative citation rate (OA: non-OA) in 19 fields of research. This rate is defined as the mean citation rate of OA articles divided by the mean citation rate of non-OA articles. Multiple points for the same discipline indicate different estimates from the same study, or estimates from several studies. References by discipline: Agricultural studies (Kousha and Abdoli, 2010); Physics/astronomy (Gentil-Beccot et al., 2010; Harnad and Brody, 2004; Metcalfe, 2006); Medicine (Sahu et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2011); Computer science (Lawrence, 2001); Sociology/social sciences (Hajjem et al., 2006; Norris et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2011); Psychology (Hajjem et al., 2006); Political science (Hajjem et al., 2006; Antelman, 2004; Atchison and Bull, 2015); Management (Hajjem et al., 2006); Law (Donovan et al., 2015; Hajjem et al., 2006); Economics (Hajjem et al., 2006; McCabe and Snyder, 2015; Norris et al., 2008; Wohlrabe, 2014); Mathematics (Antelman, 2004; Davis and Fromerth, 2007; Norris et al., 2008); Health (Hajjem et al., 2006); Engineering (Antelman, 2004; Koler-Povh et al., 2014); Philosophy (Antelman, 2004); Education (Hajjem et al., 2006; Zawacki-Richter et al., 2010); Business (Hajjem et al., 2006; McCabe and Snyder, 2015); Communication studies (Zhang, 2006); Ecology (McCabe and Snyder, 2014; Norris et al., 2008); Biology (Frandsen, 2009b; Hajjem et al., 2006; McCabe and Snyder, 2014). |

Anther benefit of openness is that while research collaborations are essential to advancing knowledge, identifying and connecting with appropriate collaborators is not trivial. Open practices can make it easier for researchers to connect with one another by increasing the discoverability and visibility of one’s work, facilitating rapid access to novel data and software resources, and creating new opportunities to interact with and contribute to ongoing communal projects.

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level
It is useful, but not necessary, to be familiar with version control and particularly that chapter's section on GitHub.

## Credit

Handling datasets as persistently identified, independently published items is a key element for allowing citation and long term integration of datasets into text as well as supporting a variety of data management activities. It would be an incentive to the author if a data publication had the rank of a citeable publication, adding to their reputation and ranking among their peers.

The German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB) developed and promotes the use of Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) for datasets. A DOI name is used to cite and link to electronic resources (text as well as research data and other types of content). The DOI System differs from other reference systems commonly used on the Internet, such as the URL, since it is permanently linked to the object itself, not just to the place in which the object is located. As a major advantage, the use of the DOI system for registration permits the scientists and the publishers to use the same syntax and technical infrastructure for the referencing of datasets that are already established for the referencing of articles. The DOI system offers persistent links as stable references to scientific content and an easy way to connect the article with the underlying data.

[Citing data](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/cite-datasets) **Creative Commons**

The DOI System is an identifier scheme administered by the International DOI Foundation.

The task of managing DOI registers is delegated to registration agencies that each specialise in a type of resource. For research datasets, the registration agency is the DataCite Consortium.[39] The consortium is made up of libraries and data centres from across the globe, led by the German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB). Among the services it provides are human and machine interfaces for simple end-user administration of DOI registrations. DataCite also collects metadata about each dataset it registers.[40] These metadata may be searched through a Web interface[41] or harvested using OAI-PMH.[42]

Any repository wishing to register DOIs needs to obtain a username and password from DataCite to gain access to the registration service. Alternatively, the organisation can manage its DOIs through a third-party service such as EZID.
While best practice has yet to emerge on some matters, certain conventions are already becoming established.

When organisations register a DOI for a resource, they should not introduce semantic elements into the suffix, especially not metadata that might change over time (e.g. publisher, archive, owner).
As DOIs are used to cite data as evidence, the resource to which a DOI points should also remain unchanged, with any new version receiving a new DOI.

Once an identifier has been assigned to (a version/snapshot of) a resource, ensure that it and any explanatory metadata remain static over time. Ensure that the identifiers remain unique and associated with the correct versions.

Assign identifiers to static datasets only when no further changes or corrections are expected (i.e. after quality control checks are complete). For dynamic datasets, assign identifiers when new snapshots or time slices are created, whether this is on a regular basis or on demand.

The world is witnessing a significant global transformation, facilitated by technology and digital media, and fueled by data and information. This transformation has enormous potential to foster more transparent, accountable, efficient, responsive, and effective research.
 Only a very small proportion of the original data is published in conventional scientific journals. Existing policies on data archiving notwithstanding, in today’s practice data are primarily stored in private files, not in secure institutional repositories, and effectively are lost to the public. This lack of access to scientific data is an obstacle to international research for two main reasons:

1. It is generally difficult or impossible to fully reproduce a scientific study without the original data.
2. It often causes unnecessary duplication of research efforts; large amounts of research funds are spent every year to recreate already existing data. Further it inhibits joint research activities on various aspects of the same problem.

Accordingly, there is an ongoing global data revolution that seeks to advance collaboration and the creation and expansion of effective, efficient research programs. Open data is crucial to meeting these objectives.
Open data means that the data is freely available on the internet permitting any user to download, copy, analyse, re-process, and re-use it for any other purpose without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself.
This represents a real shift in how research works. At the moment anyone who wishes to use scientific data from a researcher often has to contact that researcher and make a request. Open by default turns this on its head and says that there should be a presumption of publication for all. Researchers need to justify data that’s kept closed, for example for security or data protection reasons.
Free access to, and subsequent use of, data is of significant value to society and the economy, and that data should, therefore, be open by default. So, how do you go about making your data open?

### Steps to make your data open

#### Step 1: Make your data available

Put your data online. It should be easily discoverable and accessible, and made available without bureaucratic or administrative barriers, which can deter people from accessing the data. Choose a location to store the data which will ensure historical copies of datasets are preserved, archived, and kept accessible as long as they retain value. As much as possible researchers should provide data in its original, unmodified form.

Data should be free of charge, under an open license, (for example, those developed by Creative Commons) so it can be reused and remixed by other researchers. The data should be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost i.e. no expensive piece of software should be required to read the file as this may obstruct researchers who wish to work with the dataset.

#### Step 2: Make your data easy to understand

Having data available is of no use if it cannot be understood. For example a table of numbers is useless if there are no headings which describe what the columns/rows contain. Therefore you should ensure that open datasets include consistent core metadata, and that the data is fully described. This requires that all documentation accompanying data is written in clear, plain language, and that data users have sufficient information to understand the source, strengths, weaknesses, and analytical limitations of the data so that they can make informed decisions when using it.

#### Step 3: Make your data easy to use

The data should be made available in a modifiable, machine-readable format so that it can be effectively used and  manipulated.
It is also important to think about the file formats that information is provided in. Data should be presented in structured and standardized formats to support interoperability, traceability, and effective reuse. In many cases, this will include providing data in multiple, standardized formats, so that it can be processed by computers and used by people.

#### Step 4: Make your data citeable

Data should be considered legitimate, citable product of research. Making data citeable (and citing data yourself) facilitate giving scholarly credit; in scholarly literature, whenever and wherever a claim relies upon data, the corresponding data should be cited.
Data citations facilitate identification of, access to, and verification of the specific data that support a claim, making science more reproducible. Ensure that anyone wishing to cite a dataset you host can use a persistent identifier that you provide to do so.

A data citation should include a persistent method for identification that is unique, and widely understandable by a community.
There are several types of persistent identifier that could be used to identify datasets: examples include Handles, Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) and Persistent URLs (PURLs), all of which can be resolved to an Internet location. The scheme that is gaining most traction is the Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

Choose an identifier scheme which allows the identifier to be resolved to a URL. This URL should belong to a landing page that contains descriptive information about the dataset, as well as links or instructions for accessing it. You should also ensure that datasets are made citable and identifiable at an appropriate level of granularity, i.e it would be no use citing CERN's entire data repository as someone attempting to reproduce your work would not be able to find the data used in a specific piece of work without considerable difficulty. Where possible it should be possible to cite the data used, and only the data used.

### Barriers to data sharing

Sometimes it may not be possible to make data publicly available in its entirety or even in part. There are two main reasons this may be the case:

#### Privacy

Many fields of scientific disciplines involve working with sensitive personal data, medical research being the most obvious example.
Individuals must be protected from (re)identification via their personal data used for research. Anonymisation of the data may be sufficient in some cases, but ensuring that reidentification is not possible is becoming increasingly difficult due to technical progress, growing computational power and – ironically – more open data. For example reidentification may be possible via data-mining of accessible data and so-called quasi-identifiers, a set of (common) properties that are – in their combination – so specific that they can be used to identify.

Preserving privacy may still be possible if partial or generalised datasets are provided e.g. age bands instead of birth date or only the first two digits of postal codes. It may also be possible to provide the data in such a format that researchers can query it whist keeping the data itself closed, e.g. a user may be able to send a query to retrieve the mean of a dataset, but not be able to access any of the individual datapoints.

#### National and commercially sensitive data

In many cases companies are understandably unwilling to publish much of their data. The reasoning goes that if commercially sensitive information of a company is disclosed, it will damage the company’s commercial interests and undermine competitiveness. This is based on the thinking that in competitive markets, innovation will only occur with some protection of information: if a company spends time and money developing something new, the details of which are then made public, then its competitors can easily copy it without having to invest the same resources. The result is that no-one would innovate in the first place. Similarly governments are often unwilling to publish data that relates to issues such as national security due to public safety concerns.

In such cases it may not be possible to make data open, or it may only be only possible to share partial/obscured datasets as outlined in the section above on privacy.

## Open Source software

Materials used: [1.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/16800) **Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)** [2.](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/) **CC BY 3.0** [3.](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/) **(CC BY 4.0)** [4.](https://opensource.guide/)


### What is open source software?

When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license. Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly. In its most basic form open sourcing your software simply means putting your code online where it can be viewed and reused by others.

Many of the most widely used research software is open source. Perhaps the paradigmatic example is the scikit-learn Python package for machine learning (Pedregosa et al., 2011), which, in the space of just over five years, has attracted over 500 unique contributors, 20,000 individual code contributions, and 2,500 article citations. Producing a comparable package using a traditional closed-source approach would likely not be feasible, and would, at the very least, have required a budget of tens of millions of dollars. While scikit-learn is clearly an outlier, hundreds of other open-source scientific packages that support much more domain-specific needs depend in a similar fashion on unsolicited community contributions e.g., the NIPY group of projects in neuroimaging (Gorgolewski et al., 2016). Importantly, such contributions not only result in new functionality from which the broader scientific community can benefit, but also regularly provide their respective authors with greater community recognition, and lead to new project and employment opportunities.

Researchers that make use of open source projects often make changes to them such as adding features they need for their own research, or fixing bugs. They can then contribute these improvements back to the main project

### How running and contributing to open source software projects benefits you

- Improve existing skills. Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you on an open source project. Further, open source necessitates cleaner, more maintainable code to enable collaboration between potentially thousands of people that may never meet. This helps to build and maintain good coding habits. Not to be underestimated are the people skills you can develop on open source projects.
Open source offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.
- Advance your career. By definition, all of your open source work is public and this presents opportunities:
  - Demonstrate technical ability. Technical interviews traditionally involve working on a simulated problem that can be tackled in a set amount of time with little additional context. Such simulations, by definition, aren't real world use cases, nor do they show what working with an applicant would be like. Open source provides visibility into both how a candidate solves problems, and how they work with others. You make a much more appealing employee if an employer can see the quality of your work and see you working with others over a long period of time rather than taking a chance on a single short, high-stress case which may not play to your strengths.
  - Reputation. Becoming an active member of the open source community can gain you a positive reputation which may bolster future job prospects
- Meet people who are interested in similar things. Open source projects with warm, welcoming communities keep people coming back for years and many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in open source.
- Find mentors and teach others. Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.

#### Making your own work open source

- Making your work openly available for re-use makes it much more likely others will incorporate it into their own research, which leads to increased citations.
- When you write closed source software, the only developers that can potentially detect, diagnose, triage, and resolve software bugs are those that have a copy of the code. If your project is open the number of potentially contributing developers and thus the potential knowledge pool is orders of magnitude larger.
- Feedback. Making your work open enables you to get feedback and improve your project in way you may never have thought of alone.
- Accountability. There is an argument that any software developed using government money should be open source by default- if the public has paid for its development they have a right to make use of it. If your work is government funded making it open is a step you can take towards making government openness and  accountability.

#### How contributing to open source projects benefits you

- It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones. You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in open source. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? On an open source project, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.
- It's fun. Open source provides an endless set of ever-changing set of Rubix cubes for you to solve on weekends. Just like puzzles, both crossword and jigsaw, open source provides bite-sized intellectual escapes.

### How open source software benefits science

Open source projects primarily benefit science by allowing researchers to take advantage of each other's work. This enables researchers to apply their efforts to  high-value work. It is sometimes said that "all the easy problems have already been solved". Blogging, content management, and operating systems are all problems with established (and mainstream) open source solutions, to name a few. While developers could spend their time reinventing wheels that the open source community have already perfected, it's far preferable to use the worlds best wheel, especially when that wheel comes at no cost to you. This frees researchers up to work on yet-unsolved challenges. This reduces duplication of effort and allows researchers to focus on the work they're actually interested in.

Working openly also allows any number of researchers to collaborate on projects that could not possibly be developed by single researchers/research groups. Examples include linux operating systems, python packages such as scipy and numpy, and Google's machine learning library TensorFlow.    

### How to run your own open source project

You can open source an idea, a work in progress, or after years of being closed source. At the most basic level all you need to do is but your code online somewhere that is likely to last a long time. A popular place to do this GitHub (see the chapter on version control). You must include a license file stating that anyone has permission to use, copy and modify your work. Without this no one can legaly use your work and so it isn't open source. [This](https://choosealicense.com/) website offers a very simple mechanism to help you pick the best license for your project. There are also a few other files you should include:

#### Readme

You should include a readme file where you include useful information about what the project is, how to use it and how to contribute to it. Here's a list of the main things a readme should include:

- The project name and what it is. This will greatly help someone that comes across it to get an idea of the project. Include a few key points that describe the main features of the project and what are the main features you're implementing.
This helps to quickly compare other projects with yours and to give an idea that why the project exists in the first place.
- Instructions on how to install the project. The installer might be a collaborator, someone that comes across and is interested in the project, or even you if you get a new machine and need to re-install your project. Nevertheless, it's a total waste of both of your resources to start figuring out how to just get started with the project. This should also include any prerequisites that will be needed to run the project.
The best thing you can do is to just write up the installation instructions when you first do them yourself, and you'll quickly save hours of work in the future.
- Instructions for how to run the project and any associated tests. If you've been working on your project it may seem obvious how to run it, but this will likely not be the case for someone coming across it for the first time.
- Links to related material
- List of authors/contributors to the project, possibly with contact information
- Acknowledgements

If you intend for other people to collaborate on your project (as opposed to just making your code available and considering it complete) then you should include contributing guidelines and most likely a code of conduct.

#### Contributing guidelines

Contributing guidelines tell your audience how to participate in your project. For example, you might include information on:

- How to file a bug report (try using issue and pull request templates)
- How to suggest a new feature
- How to set up your environment and run tests
- Your roadmap or vision for the project
- How contributors should (or should not) get in touch with you

Using a warm, friendly tone and offering specific suggestions for contributions (such as writing documentation, or making a website) can go a long way in making newcomers feel welcomed and excited to participate. For example, Active Admin starts its contributing guide with: "First off, thank you for considering contributing to Active Admin. It’s people like you that make Active Admin such a great tool."

In the earliest stages of your project, your contributing guidelines file can be simple. You should always explain how to report bugs or file issues, and any technical requirements (like tests) to make a contribution. Over time, you might add other frequently asked questions here or in your readme file. Writing down this information means fewer people will ask you the same questions over and over again. It's also a good idea to link to your contributing guidelines file from your readme, so more people see it.

#### Code of conduct

A code of conduct helps set ground rules for behaviour for your project's participants. This is especially valuable if you're launching an open source project for a community or company. A code of conduct empowers you to facilitate healthy, constructive community behaviour, which will reduce your stress as a maintainer. In addition to communicating how you expect participants to behave, a code of conduct also tends to describe who these expectations apply to, when they apply, and what to do if a violation occurs.

Much like open source licenses, there are also emerging standards for codes of conduct, so you don't have to write your own. The [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/) is a drop-in code of conduct that is used by [over 40,000 open source projects](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters). No matter which text you use, you should be prepared to enforce your code of conduct when necessary.

Keep the file in your project's root directory so it's easy to find, and link to it from your readme.

### How to contribute to other's open source projects

#### Anatomy of an open source project

Every open source community is different. That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.

A typical open source project has the following types of people:

- Author: The person/s or organization that created the project
- Owner: The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
- Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
- Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
- Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.

Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project’s website for a “team” page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.

A great many open source projects are hosted on GitHub (see the chapter on version control for more detail), which has facilities such as:

- Issue tracker: Where people discuss issues related to the project.
- Pull requests: Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.
- Discussion forums or mailing lists: Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (for example, "How do I…" or "What do you think about…" instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.
- Synchronous chat channel: Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

#### Contribute your changes

Say you've added a feature or fixed a bug and want to contribute this work to the main project.

1. Read the documentation. The main project may have contributing guidelines or information in a readme instructing prospective contributors on how to supply their changes.
2. Make sure your conventions match those of the main project, both in style and structure. For example if all the variables in a project are named in some particular way yours should be too! Consistent conventions make it much easier for someone who hasn't seen your piece of the project before to understand it rather than having to figure out your particular set of conventions *and* what the code is doing. The project's conventions may be outlined in its documentation, or may just be evident from inspection of the code itself.
3. Break your changes up into manageable, well-defined chunks, e.g if you've added two separate features don't submit them together. Keeping things "clean" in this way makes your work simpler to understand and review.
4. Test your changes. If the project comes with tests run them, and make sure you're testing against an up to date version of the project as it may have evolved considerably over time. Write specific tests for your changes and submit those too.
5. Don't just submit code- update any relevant documentation too. If your changes are incorporated it will have to be undated, if you don't do it someone else will have to.
6. Ask questions. If there are things you are unsure about there's no harm in asking. Many larger projects have dedicated forums or other venues for questions and discussion.
7. When you submit your changes clearly describe the changes you've made, why you've made them, and how they have been implemented. This makes it as easier for someone looking at your work and deciding whether to incorporate it into the main project to do so. In the likely case the main project is hosted on GitHub you should put this in the pull request (see the version control chapter for more details).

#### Looking for projects to contribute to and how to contribute to them

You don’t need to overthink what exactly your first contribution will be, or how it will look. Instead, start by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. The projects you’ll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to. Within those projects, whenever you catch yourself thinking that something could be better or different, act on your instinct. You might scan a readme and find a broken link or a typo. Or you’re a new user and you noticed something is broken, or an issue that you think should really be in the documentation. Instead of ignoring it and moving on, or asking someone else to fix it, see whether you can help out by pitching in. That’s what open source is all about!

You can also use one of the following resources to help you discover and contribute to new projects:

- [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/)
- [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)
- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)

If you're not sure how to start here's a few other ways you can go about it such as finding an open issue to tackle or asking if you can help write a new feature.

A common misconception about contributing to open source is that you need to contribute code. In fact, it’s often the other parts of a project that are most neglected or overlooked. You’ll do the project a huge favour by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!

- Review code on other people’s submissions
- Write and improve the project’s documentation
- Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used
- Answer questions about the project on e.g., Stack Overflow (like this Postgres example) or Reddit
- Keep things organized, e.g. on GitHub by

### What is open access?

One of the most common ways to disseminate research results is by writing a manuscript and publishing it in a journal, conference proceedings or book. For many years those publications were available to the public under a payment by means of a subscription fee or individually. However, new knowledge is built by synthesizing current scholarship and then building upon it. At the turn of the 21st century a new movement appeared with a clear objective: make all the research results available to anyone interested in reading it, free of charge by any user, with no technical obstacles such as mandatory registration or login to specific platforms. This movement took the name of Open Access and established two initial strategies to achieve its final goal: self archiving and open access publishing.

#### Repositories and self archiving

This aims to provide tools and assistance to scholars to deposit their refereed journal articles in open electronic repositories.  As a result of the first strategy we see self-archiving practices: researchers depositing and disseminating papers in institutional or subject based repositories. There has also been a growth in the publication of preprints through institutional repositories and preprint servers. Preprints are widely used in physical sciences and now emerging in life sciences and other fields. Preprints are documents that have not been peer reviewed but are considered as a complete scientific publication in a first stage. Some of the preprints servers include open peer review services and the availability to post new versions of the initial paper once reviewed by peers.

At the beginning of 2018 more than 4000 repositories are available for researchers to self-archive their publications according to the [Registry of Open Access Repositories](http://roar.eprints.org/). In this list we can find institutional repositories, subject based or thematic repositories and harvesters. The first ones are generally managed by research performing institutions to provide to their community a place to archive and share openly papers and other research outputs. Subject based repositories are usually managed by research communities and most of the contents are related to a certain discipline. Finally, harvesters aggregate content from different repositories becoming sites to perform general searches and build other value-added services.

When choosing a journal to publish research results, researchers should take a moment to read the journal policy regarding the transfer of copyright. Many journals still require for publication that authors transfer full copyright. This transfer of rights implies that authors must ask for permission to reuse their own work beyond what is allowed by the applicable law and unless there are some uses already granted. Among those granted uses we can find teaching purposes, sharing with colleagues, and especially how researchers can self-archive their papers in repositories. Sometimes there a common policy among all the journals published by the same publishers but in general journals have their own policy, especially when they are published on behalf of a scientific society. When looking at the self-archiving conditions we must identify two key issues: the version of the paper that can be deposited and when it can be publicly available.

Regarding the version, some journals allow the dissemination of the submitted version, also known as preprint, and they allow its replacement for a reviewed version once the final paper has been published. Due to the increase of policies requiring access to research results, most of the journals allow to deposit the accepted version of the paper, also known as the author manuscript or postprint. This version is the final text once the peer review process has ended but it has not the final layout of the publication. Finally some journals allow researchers to deposit the final published version, also known as the version of record.

In relation to the moment to make the paper publicly available, many journals establish a period of time from its original publication: the embargo period, which can range from zero to 60 months. Some journals include or exclude embargoes depending on the versions. For instance the accepted version could be made publicly available after publication but the published version must wait 12 months.


#### Open Access publishing

This attempts to ensure permanent open access to all the articles published in journals. And as a result of the second strategy we have seen the creation of the open access journals. The number of Open Access Journals has increased during the last years. According to the Directory of Open Access Journals \([DOAJ](http://www.doaj.org)\), currently there are more than 12,000 journals. Open access journal must provide free access to its contents but it also must license them to allow reusability.

Currently many paywalled journals offer individual open access options to researchers once the paper is accepted after peer review. Those options include the publication under a free content license and free accessibility to anyone since its first publication. This model is commonly known as the hybrid model because in the same issue of a journal, readers can find open access and paywalled contributions. Usually publishers ask for a fee to open individual contributions.

Open access publishing has two primary versions—gratis and libre. Gratis open access is simply making research available for others to read without having to pay for it. However, it does not grant the user the right to make copies, distribute, or modify the work in any way beyond fair use. Libre open access is gratis, meaning the research is available free of charge, but it goes further by granting users additional rights, usually via a Creative Commons license, so that people are free to reuse and remix the research. There are varying degrees of what may be considered Libre open access. For example, some scholarly articles may permit all uses except commercial use, some may permit all uses except derivative works, and some may permit all uses and simply require attribution. While some would argue that Libre open access should be free of any copyright restrictions (except attribution), other scholars consider a work that removes at least some permission barriers to be libre.

In addition to the gratis/libre distinction regarding users’ rights to a work, there are also distinctions regarding the venue in which open access works are published and archived—green and gold. Green open access involves authors self-archiving their articles by sharing them on their own website, or more preferably, in their institution's Institutional Repository or in some other public archive. Some publishers request that Open Access be granted only after an embargo period has elapsed. This embargo period can last anywhere between several months and several years. For publications that have been deposited in a repository but are under embargo, usually at least the metadata are openly accessible.

Gold open access articles are published in a journal that is open access, which means the journal will handle hosting and distributing the journal article in a free and open manner, and the published work is made available in Open Access mode by the publisher immediately upon publication. Gold open access can come with a cost—some gold open access journals have publication fees that need to paid by the author (or the author's employer) to cover the cost of publishing the article. These publication fees can be costly, but thankfully less than a third of gold open access journals have a publication fee. Currently, most Gold open access journals are still publishing gratis (free of charge to read) as opposed to libre (free of charge to read, copy, distribute, etc).

### Why does open access matter?

Research is useless if it’s not shared: even the best research is ineffectual if others aren’t able to read and build on it. When price barriers keep articles locked away, science cannot achieve its full potential. Open access benefits researchers who can work more effectively with a better understanding of the literature. It also helps avoid duplication of effort. No researcher (or funder) wants to waste time and money conducting a study if they know it has been attempted elsewhere. But, duplication of effort is all-too-possible when researchers can’t effectively communicate with one another and make results known to others in their field and beyond. It also benefits researchers by providing better visibility and therefore higher impact/citation rate for their scholarship.  Numerous publishers, both non-profit and for-profit, voluntarily make their articles openly available at the time of publication or within 6-12 months.  Many have switched from a closed, subscription model to an open one as a strategic business decision to increase their journal's exposure and impact. Further it can be argued that taxpayers who pay for much of the research published in journals have a right to access the information resulting from that investment without charge. Finally, if research is available to the widest possible pool of readers then it is more likely/easy for it to be checked and reproduced.  

### Best practice for open access

#### Self-archiving

Self archive a publication in a suitable repository, institutional or subject-based, following the possible restrictions posed by the publisher, mainly related to the allowed version to be deposit and the embargo period. In doing this it is important to make sure you are aware of the copyright implications of any documents/agreements you make when submitting your manuscript to a journal. If your institution does not have an institutional repository, advocate for the creation of one.

#### Publication

Consider submitting your work to a journal that is open access. When doing this be aware that there may be funds or discounts available to cover any associated costs.
