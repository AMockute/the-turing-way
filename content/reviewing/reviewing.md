## Summary

Code review provides an additional way of testing code quality. Instead of relying simply on [tests](#Testing) which the original author puts together themselves, code review gets another programmer to look over the new code and assess it. The goal is to point out strengths and also potential areas of improvement.

Code review is often done in pairs, with each reviewer also having some of their code reviewed by their partner. Doing this can help programmers see and discuss issues, alternative approaches to tasks, and learn tips and tricks. This means code review practices are particularly well-suited to larger scale projects with more than one contributor already attached to the project and working on different parts of the code. Nonetheless, even smaller scale teams can harness these aspects with some creative project management.

Because of their nature code reviews act a qualitative rather than quantitive tests, but are no less valuable for that.

This section will provide an overview of review workflows and best practice. Later sections will focus in particular on github's code review functionality as a powerful and widely-used example of a formal code review system; however, equivalent systems are available elsewhere (e.g., [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com)), and even informal code review practices can also be very powerful.
