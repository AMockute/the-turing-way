## The Turing Way Book
*For the main repo (where most of the issues live, check out [this one](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way)*

All the text for each chapter lives inside it's own folder in the `content/` directory.

Everything else is in the `website/`.

The site is built automatically using these two directories. If you want to see your local changes on your own computer you'll have to go in the website directory and enter `make serve`.
